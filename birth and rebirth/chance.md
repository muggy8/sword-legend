# Chance

It took me a long time to realize but Maria has replaced Mom and Johan has replaced Dad. 

The way they acted is the exact same way that Mom and Dad used to act.

They even talk like Mom and Dad did.

Lucy also got bigger, almost as big as Maria.

Machala was bigger as well. Just not as big as Lucy.

Maria and Lucy would take turns taking care of yet another pair of small people.

The bigger one was called Andrew and could walk around on two limbs.

The smaller one was called Kelly and had to be carried by Maria or Machala.

Machala didn't object to the task but it was very clear that she didn't like it.

Lucy, for some reason, wasn't home all too often now.

Johan would take her with him to The Workshop every day and by the time they came back, Maria was already absorbed in the process of cooking.

Machala would sometimes join her and sometimes, Machala would sometimes perform the cooking ritual as well.

Of course, with the family now bigger, another container with a Pan Handle joined me in the fire and at the table meaning there's now three of us in total.

The number of times I'd watch every fall into stillness had also increased as well.

There were even times when I would be awake until light returned to the room and everyone started moving once more.

To my knowledge, the stillness that happens after the lights go out is also called sleep.

But this sleep isn't the same as my sleep it seems because they still move during their sleep, if only ever so slightly and very rarely.

It is during these times of stillness that I find myself wishing I could move the most.

I didn't dislike the stillness, but I didn't enjoy it either.

It was as if time stopped, yet I did not stop.

My mind would drift from one thing in the room to another and then back again.

Tonight was no different. 

My mind was drifting from place to place in the room and I ended up focusing on Andrew.

He reminded me of Jimmy and Jimmy reminded me of Mom and Dad. 

Not Maria and Johan but the Mom and Dad before them. 

I missed them.

Maria and Johan were really good at being Mom and Dad but they aren't Mom and Dad.

Thinking this, I turned my gaze over to the side to look at Maria closely.

She really did look like Mom. 

Of course, there were differences but if I hadn't been awake so much and saw the changes first hand, I would have likely mistaken Maria for Mom.

Well, would I?

I mean, the last time I saw mom, she was quite different from what Maria looked like now.

Then why did I think Maria looked like Mom?

Oh right, it was when Maria was the size of Kelly.

The Maria of right now looked so much like Mom did during the time when Maria was the size of Kelly.

I wonder if one day Lucy or Machala would end up looking like Maria...

No, Lucy already looks like Maria when Maria was the same size as Lucy.

As I continued to reflect upon my past, I started noticing something strange.

I was no longer on the roof.

Instead, I was resting in the soft sheets.

I tried to look towards the roof where I was and I noticed myself hanging from the roof.

A Pan Handle connected to a round container of some kind.

There were strange markings carved into the Pan Handle. 

There were others around too. 

What was happening?

I didn't know.

I tried to look around and saw Maria next to me.

I looked the other way and Kelly was beside me.

I tried to look at myself only to discovered that my consciousness is now attached to Andrew.

He looked exactly the same as before, still, unmoving, eyes closed, I didn't know what to make of it.

I didn't know what to make of it but this change frightened me.

What was going on.

Before I knew it, I was back in my own body, hanging from the roof.

There were others like me hanging around with me and Maria and Kelly were once again far away.

What just happened?

I was scared.

Something strange happened.

But despite losing track of my body, a sense of excitement welled up within me.

I don't know what happened, but I was able to see the world from Andrew's perspective.

But just experiencing this excited me.

I wanted to try it again...

Why do I want to try that again?

What if I could never come back to my body anymore?

What would happen to me if I cant return anymore.

What if I disappear just like Jimmy, Mom or Dad?

But the allure of seeing the room from a different angle was too great and in the end I gathered up all of my courage and gave it another try.

I promised myself that if anything would happen, I would get back here as soon as possible.

So once again, I focused on Andrew once more.

I looked at him with all my might, but nothing happened.

Shutting everything else out, I focused on him even more, yet nothing happened.

I tried everything I could, but nothing happened. 

I tried the same with Kelly, with Maria, with Lucy, with everyone, but like with Andrew, nothing happened.

A great sense of disappointment filled me as the darkness faded and light once again returned to the room. 

Johan woke up first and then Maria.

Soon, the two of them went though the door as they frequently did during the first light after the darkness.

Kelly started crying shortly after which woke everyone else up.

Before long, Johan and Maria transformed the room back into the way it was before the darkness blanketed everything.

I kept on trying to move to Andrew hopelessly but before long, I found myself falling asleep once more filled with nothing but disappointment.
