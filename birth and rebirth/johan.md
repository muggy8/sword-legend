# **Johan**

Today, once again, I'm surrounded by familiar faces.

Mom was there, Dad was there, Maria was there.

And the bigger version of the annoying small person is there too.

This time, It knew how to speak.

"Why is Pandle written on the pan's handle?"

Mom didn't immediately answer.

Instead she looked around the room before turning back towards the small child and answering.

"When mommy was small, much smaller than you are right now, mommy accidentally called this pan Pandle. Mommy's mommy said that mommy wouldn't call it anything else so eventually, everyone just started it‘Pandle’."

"I've heard this story from sis already. But why is Pandle written into the pan handle?"

Mom didn't answer.

Dad didn't answer.

Maria...

I think she wanted to answer but for some reason, she held her tong.

The deafening silence continued for who knows how long before the child asked something else.

"Mom, you should teach me how to cook. Dad is teaching me how to smith but you never taught me anything."

"Why'd you want to learn how to cook? It's so tedious and annoying." Maria interjected.

"Eating food is fun. If I know how to cook, I bet I can help mom cook so we can eat more food."

"I think you have the wrong idea of cooking. But if you're going to learn how to cook then you should trade with me. I wanna smith. Smiting seems so cool and awesome."

"Just so you know, smiting is stupid and boring."

Mom and Dad seemed to both let out a sigh as the verbal fight continued but they made no attempt to stop the two and allowed it to continue.

It's in times like this that I am reminded so much of the days that Jimmy was around.

I wonder where he is now.

...

Today, I awakened to a completely different sight.

The room I was in was different, there were so many people everywhere that I could hardly count them all.

They were all talking among themselves that it was impossible to make out what any individual one of them were saying.

No matter where I looked, there were people.

I was, as usual, on the table and contained within me was whatever Mom had put there earlier.

But I wasn't the only container with a Pan Handle on the table this time.

Instead, there were quite a few others like me around.

They looked different from me, they felt different from me, but the all had the same general shape as me.

A Pan Handle attached to some sort of container.

Some of them were taller than me, others were wider.

Some of the Pan Handles were made of the same stuff the containers were, and others didn't.

There were even some others who had multiple things that looked like Pan Handles but the extension curved back and re-attached itself onto the container somewhere else.

I've never seen so many others like me all together at the same time.

Today must have been something of a special day.

Mom, Dad, Maria and the annoying brat were all around too.

Of course they are, Things wouldn't be normal without them.

Every so often, someone I don't recognize would come over to me or one of the other containers to extract some of our contents into smaller containers before going away.

I didn't know any of these people but Mom and Dad seem to be friendly with them.

Maria hasn't changed much but the annoying brat did.

He seemed bigger and bulkier now as well.

well... looking at Maria again, she did change.

She wasn't wearing her usual getup today. She was wearing something different that made her stand out from the crowd, something I've never seen before.

There was another person who seemed to be by her time this whole time.

I didn't recognize the person, but I could tell he was someone like the annoying brat.

He was kind of bulky like the brat and gave off a feeling of being strong.

He was also wearing something that made him stand out from everyone else in the crowd.

I didn't like him much since he reminded me of the annoying brat but Maria seemed to like spending her time with him.

I didn't really understand.

but everyone seemed happy, even Mom and Dad seemed to be extremely happy.

I haven't seen them this happy since the last time I saw Jimmy.

I don't think I'll ever see Jimmy again.

How long ago was it that I last saw him, I wonder.

But my consciousness didn't last long enough for me to think about Jimmy.

Soon enough, I fell asleep once more.

...

"Hey, Pandle. Do you think I'll ever be able to cook as well as mom did?"

Today I woke up to a completely different scene from all the other times I've awoken.

Maria was before me, and Mom was nowhere around.

Not only that, she was talking directly to me.

This was a strange new experience.

I tried to answer but I didn't know how.

Did I even try to answer?

And what even is cooking anyways?

And how do you Become Mom. Isn't Mom's name Mom?

I didn't know, I couldn't answer, I couldn't even do anything.

So with nothing to do, I just remained stationary before Maria and observed her.

After a bit of time, I noticed that something was different about her today.

She was still the same Maria I had known but she had a different feel about her.

Normally she'd give off this feeling of playfulness, but not today.

Instead, she looked uncertain.

Before long, she was doing the things that Mom used to do.

She placed me over a fire and started putting liquids into my container.

First it was some thick sticky liquid, then some chunky bits.

She started stirring the stuff in my container with some sort of a tool in the same way that Mom used to but the way that Maria stirred was different.

It was a strangely different yet familiar feeling.

Eventually, more stuff was added to my container and at some point, like Mom has done so many times in the past, Maria took me away from the fire and placed me onto a table.

This time, Mom, Dad and the annoying brat weren't here anymore.

Instead, it was just Maria and the bulky person she was hanging out with in the crowd last time.

I didn't know how I felt about this but I didn't like him.

He reminded me of the annoying brat.

"How's your first day after graduating from black smith apprenticeship today Johan?"

"Honestly, not as much of a difference as any other day honestly."

"What do you intend to do now? Get your own workshop?"

"Not really. I know one day, I'll have to do that eventually, but I don't really know when that day will be."

"Honestly, I think you should do that sooner than later. I don't like dad very much."

"Don't say that, he's the best and most experienced smith in town. Most towns don't have a smith anywhere nearly as skilled as he is."

"Honestly, I don't understand why everyone holds him in such high regard. Not like one sharp metal stick is going to be that different from another sharp metal stick."

"Maria, don't say that. Sure two different swords might look and work similarly but when you have to trust your life to the weapon, you'd want to make sure the weapon is as good as possible."

"..."

"Why do you hate your father so much?"

"I think he hates me."

"What makes you say that? He's your father, shouldn't he be one of the few people who loves you the most."

"Clearly not. He'd refuse to ever take me to the workshop with him and he always forced me to stay with mom and do housework. Whenever I would go visit him at the workshop, he'd always send me back. Not only that, he'd always scold me with made up excuses after he gets home. But when Teddy turned 10, he happily took him to the workshop. I'm supposed to be the older sibling but he treats me like some sort of house cleaner. He doesn't even care about what I..."

The bulky person called Johan walked over to hug Maria mid way though her talk and hugged her.

"It's ok, I get it, I get it." he said and Maria stopped talking from this action.

After a few moments, Johan returned to his seat and began the conversation once more.

"How much do you want to leave? 1 to 10."

"I'd say... 7 or 8. I'll miss mom. But I don't like dad. He makes me upset."

"I see. I see. I'll see what I can do about it."
