# **Stillness**

Time has changed, I don't know when, nor do I know why.

But time has changed and this is something I have to come to terms with.

The only reason I know is because of how slowly things change around me.

Each time I woke up in the past, the people around me would get bigger without fail.

Yet now, each time I wake up, I can hardly tell if anything changed.

Maria is still the same as she was.

Johan still seemed the same.

Lucy was the one of the few who changed but even then, I could hardly tell the difference.

Maybe she was a small bit bigger, maybe her proportions changed a bit, maybe the way she talked changed.

Whatever it is, she has unmistakably changed.

Yet whatever the change is, there's no way I could tell exactly what that is.

All I know is that something about her changed and she became more Maria like since the last time I woke up.

The only one who changed the most was the small being named 'Machala' who was crawling around previously.

Last time she was crawling around on all fours but now, it looks like she was able to walk on two limbs like the rest of the members of the room.

I could easily tell that she's much bigger now; though I can't really say by how much.

Today, like the many times in recent memory, I wasn't the only container with a Pan Handle on the table.

Beside me was another one just like me.

Maria and Johan were pulling scooping things out from the two of us and putting them into smaller containers that were then placed in front of each of them that sat around us.

It was a familiar sight that I have gotten used to.

Machala one didn't talk much at all which I guess was nice.

Lucy, in contrast, wouldn't stop talking.

She was starting to feel like the annoying brat to me.

But before she could start talking too much, she started eating.

Not just her, so did Maria, Johan and Machala.

After Lucy and Machala finished their food, they ran off from the table and out the door.

Maria and Johan were left in the room and they chatted about stuff.

The usual talk about everyday life, planning for things in the future, chores still left undone.

It is through these talks that I've learned much about the daily life of Maria, Johan, Lucy and Machala.

Johan spends his days in this place called The Workshop.

Maria spends her days at home taking care of Lucy and Machala.

There was this thing called 'Money' that Johan and Maria tried to collect but it doesn't seem like they're very successful in doing that.

Other than taking care of Lucy and Machala, Maria also helps take care of the others who live nearby.

Names like Thomas, Holland, Wendy, and Gloria seem to come up frequently though to me, these names were nothing more than just names.

Maria was the one with much more knowledge of what was happening than Johan.

Johan seemed to only really know about the happenings in this place called 'The Workshop', Maria was the one who knew about all the things that were happening everywhere else.

Every so often, someone I wasn't familiar with would come visit and join in on these post-eating conversations but those were rare and today was not one of those days.

It's days like today that were by far, the most common.

Just Maria and Johan talking about the same things as the previous days.

The scenery never changes anymore, the people hardly change anymore.

It's almost like time itself has stopped moving.

In one way, it was a scary feeling, like I'm trapped here forever.

But if I think about it another way, It was oddly comforting, I would always wake up to the same people surrounding me.

Maria would always place me over the fire before continuing on with this cooking ritual she always performs.

Johan would always be there after the cooking ritual along with Lucy and Machala.

It was oddly comforting to know that this was what would welcome me every time I woke up.

Thinking about things this way, my existence is actually rather comfortable and I had nothing to complain about.

Things like this continued on through my mind as I listened to Maria and Johan chat about the happenings of The Workshop and everywhere else today.

Before long, Lucy and Machala came back from the door.

This, too, wasn't anything too abnormal.

I would fall asleep before this happened on some days and on other days, I would be awake for long enough to see this happen.

What happens now feels like a scramble to transform the room.

The table I was on was moved to the side and everything on the table was moved away.

Maria would often wash me in the liquid filled hole before placing me into the fire again for a while.

While I waited in the fire, the rest of the room's transformation continued.

A soft looking sheet was placed onto the floor and covered a large portion of the room.

The other smaller fires on sticks were put out causing the amount of light in this room to decrease significantly.

Before long, Maria pulled me out of the fire pit and hung me onto the roof with the other containers.

Normally, I would have fallen asleep well before this point but today was different.

I didn't know why, but I didn't feel my consciousness slip; so I kept observing.

Lucy and Machala were the first to start laying down onto the soft looking sheet.

Soon enough, Johan and Maria joined them along with another soft looking sheet.

Before long, the fire in the firepit was extinguished and along with it, the last bit of light that illuminated this room I have come to know so well.

When the light was first extinguished, It felt as if nothing changed.

Maria and Johan continued talking for a bit.

Lucy continued talking.

Machala... didn't do much.

But before long, all of it stopped.

Machala became still, even more still than she normally was.

Her head was the only part of her you could see outside of the sheets.

Lucy was also uncharacteristically still.

Like Machala, the only part of Lucy not covered by the sheets is her head.

Now, the only movement came from Maria and Johan, but even this is nothing more than the occasional rolling and tossing and turning.

Before long, everything in this room became still and unmoving.

Maria didn't move, Lucy didn't move, Johan didn't move, Machala didn't move, and even I didn't move.

All that was left in this room was stillness.

That was the only thing I experienced as my grasp on consciousness slipped away once more.
