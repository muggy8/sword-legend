# Enshushu

Today, I woke up in the fire.

I had initially thought that this was Maria's cooking ritual but I was immediately proven wrong when I started looking around the room.

Johan, Lucy, and Andrew were around helping put away the table.

It was pretty clear that this wasn't the cooking ritual but the set up before everyone went to sleep.

Machala was helping Maria with the perp work of preparing the room for sleep.

It took me a while to find Kelly in the middle of all this chaos but eventually I did manage to do it.

She seemed to be entirely ready to sleep already and looked to have passed out already.

She also seemed just a small bit bigger than the last time I saw her.

With my recent travels around the house and such, I had realized that time seemed to have changed once more.

But this time, I had realized that it's not time that has changed, instead, it's me.

Before my exploration of the house, I had waken up much more frequently.

But now, not anymore.

I wasn't sure what I should do about it.

I wouldn't really miss out on anything if I spent most of my time sleeping.

Yet not knowing what happens to the family and being felt uncomfortable uncomfortable.

I didn't have an answer.

As I thinking about this question, Machala came over to me to take me out of the fire in order to hang me onto one of the hooks on the roof.

From this new position, I gazed down upon the all too familiar hustle of rearranging of the room.

Pretty soon, another cooking container joined me up here on the roof, and then another.

Before long, it was time to put out the fire.

However, it didn't happen exactly as I had expected.

Normally, either Machala or Maria would be the one to put out the fire but today, the one at the fire pit was Andrew.

He did exactly the same thing that Maria or Machala would normally do which was a surprise to me as I had never seen him do anything related to house chores before.

Andrew started by taking a small piece of fire from the fire pit and placing it into a smaller box which he hung onto the walls by the fire pit.

Then He took a small bowl and scooped some liquid from where Maria kept the liquids and splashed it into the fire pit.

A sharp fizzling sound erupted but soon enough, the fire was extinguished.

This is where Maria or Machala would normally leave the fire pits in order to do something else but Andrew instead knelt down by the fire pit and formed a bow with his hands, 

under the dim light of the fire in the hanging box, I could see Andrew silently whispering something.

But this didn't last long.

Soon enough, Andrew stood up and joined the rest of the family in bed.

This was a rather odd change.

Something strange was definitely happening. 

Maria or Machala would often do this task and Andrew, like Johan and Lucy, would usually never partake in these home caring rituals.

Yet here he is doing exactly that.

Not only that, it seemed that neither Maria or Machala cared much for this change.

The only reason for this is because this has been happening for quite a while.

Which means, I must have been asleep for quite a while as well.

I didn't like this feeling. 

Something changed and I was completely unaware of it,

Maybe I shouldn't be spending so much time inside the body of other things in order to watch over the family.

But this is a rather small change,

I had missed these kinds of changes all the time before and if that was what I had to go back to in exchange for moving around more frequently then that should be fine right?

Yet despite that, seeing the moment that Kelly started walking on 2 legs did feel somewhat special.

Would that mean continuing to move around would cause me to lose the opportunity to witness those situations less?

That felt oddly uncomfortable to me.

After all, I've been watching over this family for such a long time now, I felt like it was practically my duty to witness everything this family does.

But can I really claim that to be the case?

I had never seen what Lucy or Johan does at the workshop.

I had never even been to the workshop.

I don't even know what Andrew does all day long. 

Can I even claim to watch over the family when I don't even know what almost half of them are doing half of the time. 

I was filled with a great sense of dissatisfaction as I came upon this realization.

Filled with this feeling, I watched as the family went to sleep beneath me and all the comings and goings of the day come to a complete stop.

I gazed at the motionless sleeping bodies of the family as I hung motionlessly from the roof with the other cooking containers beside me.

'Greetings spirit of the pan.' echoed an unfamiliar voice. 

The voice startled me as I immediately started looking at my surroundings to find the source.

Yet I couldn't find anything that seemed like it would be the cause of the sound.

Looking down at the family, everything seemed to be normal.

And in my confusion, the voice spoke again.

'A shy one is it? That's fine. My name is Enshushu. I am the spirit of fire. what's your name?'

Upon hearing this, I immediately shifted my gaze to the tiny flame in the hanging box.

But nothing happened.

It was alarming.

This was only the second time anyone talked to me and this time, it was coming from nowhere in particular, or maybe it was coming from everywhere.

I was scared. 

I wasn't sure what to do.

I just froze there in fear.

'Hmmm... are you ok? Do you know how to talk?'

Of course I didn't.

I didn't know anything.

But that message didn't seem to have been conveyed.

'Hmm.... this seems quite troublesome indeed. You haven't said anything at all and all you're doing is looking around. How about this. If you understand what I'm saying, then fix your gaze upon the extinguished fire place. Otherwise, I'll have to assume you're far too young to communicate with'

Upon hearing this message, I momentarily considered ignoring this but the better of my judgement won and I fixed my gaze onto the fireplace.

I didn't know how long I was supposed to look at the fire place but I kept looking at it intently.

I felt like there was no end to this unending gaze I had engaged in but I wasn't sure if I should look elsewhere or not.

'That's very good. It seems that at the very least, you understand me. that's quite good to know.'

I broke my gaze towards the firepit and shifted it back to the small glowing fire.

'Now I have another question for you. Do you know how to move? If you do, try to move to one of the bowls over there by the table. If you don't then just look intently at the pan hanging next to you.'

Move?

I cant move. The only time I get moved is when someone else moves me.

Of course I couldn't.

As a result, I decided that I was going to look at the cooking container beside me.

This Enshushu person seems to call these things Pans but I know better.

These are cooking containers.

I fixed my gaze intently on the cooking container beside me as instructed.

I wasn't sure how long this would take or what would come next, but this was the only thing I could do right now.

I had never talked to anyone before but it seems that Enshushu had figure out a way to talk to me. 

Though I didn't really know where this will go, this whole event felt like something I shouldn't just toss aside. 

so all I could do now was to play along.

'Good, good. What you did just now. That's what I meant when I said move.'

Enshushu's words snapped me out of the thoughts.

It was also those words that made me realize that I had transferred myself into the cooking container beside me. 

When did this happen?

I wasn't sure but I had realized something. 

What I had been doing all this time with the experimenting and transferring around from object to object.

Apparently, this action was what Enshushu called Move.

'Oh? You still haven't returned to your own body? Quite the curious one you seem to be. Most spirits immediately return to their own bodies the first time they mange to move to somewhere else. Well no matter. You'll likely feel very tired very soon. I'll come back some time in the future. While I'm gone, try your best to practice moving just like this alright? If you do, I'll teach you some interesting things when we next meet. Until then, have a good night.'

After Enshushu finished speaking, I immediately tried to move into the bowls.

I wanted Enshushu to stay here.

I did indeed know how to move.

I just didn't know what it was called.

I felt like an idiot for wasting this opportunity and I wanted to find out more. 

Yet no matter what I did, Enshushu didn't return.

I tried to look intently at the fire in the hanging box, but nothing happened.

I continued trying to do everything I could with the fire but nothing happened still.

By the time light was returning to the outside world, I had finally came to terms with the fact that Enshushu left somehow and the only thing I could do now was wait.
