# Reincarnation

Today, I was born.

when is today? I don't know.

All I know is that I was born during the day.

The first person I saw when I opened my eyes was the face of a beautiful girl, the splitting image of my secretary Kelly in one of my pervious life.

More specifically, my secretary during the time when I was a serving as the demon lord.

But those times are long behind me now, or maybe in front of me. 

Time is such a strange oddity when it comes to reincarnating.

Not wanting to be too abnormal, I made a few random sounds and moved my little chubby limbs around.

Getting used to a new body is going to be tough.

This is easily one of the worst part of reincarnating.

But it is what It is.

Mom looked at me happily as she held me in her arms.

I looked around as well to scan my surrounding and noticed a man who must be my father helping out with odd jobs.

There were even two other kids around. 

One seemed to be around 6 while the other seemed to be around 3.

It seems that this time, I was born into a family of three children.

I wonder what kind of family this will be.

...

Today, I had finally figured out that my name in this life is Machala.

Trying to decipher language and sounds in the beginning of being born is rather difficult.

Everything sounds like a mess.

But there are patterns.

I guess this is what I get for getting my soul placed into such an underdeveloped body.

But at least I had figured out my name.

Though, to be honest, I was going to figure it out sooner or later anyways.

After all, it something that every baby eventually figures out.

Coincidentally, I had also figured out that in this life, I'm female.

Having lived my previous life as a male farmer toiling the fields all day, being able to take it easy as a wife just seems like a very nice change in pace.

I hope the men that live near by are decent.

Should I try to play a hand in making sure the kids around me grow up into decent people or should I keep to myself and let them develop naturally and hope for the best?

... Well I don't have to make any decision about this now.

There's plenty of time in the future to figure this out.

Maybe someone will even catch my eye as a kid and we'll get married after we grow up and so on.

That sounds so romantic.

Fresh new life, fresh new start.

...

Today, mom took me outside for the first time.

I've only been alive for 2 just over weeks at this point but Mom decided that she was going to take me out with her today.

I was strapped to her chest and my elder brother came with us as well.

My elder sister went out with dad early in the morning so I'm not too sure sure what she was doing.

Mom was carrying a bunch of dirty cloths with her when we went out today so I had an idea of what we were going to do.

When we arrived, mom handed me and my elder brother to another person and took off to wash the cloths with a whole group of other women around.

This was also a pretty common practice in my previous life but kept looking at her despite knowing this anyways.

The adult who was with me said some incomprehensible things to me some time ago but I didn't care for her.

Instinctively, I just wanted to look at mom. 

I longed for her to return, to be held once more, but there wasn't much I could do.

I know that it will happen eventually, but the longing wont go away.

It really sucks being in a baby's body.

...

Today, I met some of my neighbors.

The village we lived in was small and houses were somewhat spread apart.

I could see some fields for growing crops during the times when mom took me out but it definitely wasn't much.

I had guessed that our family wasn't the farming type which was cool but I wonder what they did.

Dad would go out every day and come home every evening. 

He'd talk about stuff with mom after dinner but my language skills in this body had not yet developed enough to be able to understand anything they were saying.

On the other hand, mom would often take me out with her but this time, it wasn't to the usual laundry session.

Instead, it seemed to be just a normal hangout.

Dad was here too and so was many of others men from around the village.

Actually, I recognize quite a few of the faces from the laundry sessions.

It seems that this was just a gathering of the local neighbors. 

It seems that each household's whole family was present.

I know ours was.

The kids were more or less grouped ourselves by age and started having fun by ourselves.

Of course, I wasn't old enough too do that and instead, spent the whole event being held in mom's arms.

Of course, that was perfectly fine by me, there's no where else in the world I'd rather be.

Though with that being the case, I was still looking around at the other kids and the adults.

None of them struck me as anything special.

...

Today I fount out what My dad did every day.

Mom took me and elder brother Andrew to see dad and elder sister Lucy.

We came to a place that stank of sweaty old men, burning metal and wood dust.

It was a rather unpleasant place. 

But just one glance told me that this place was a crafting workshop of some kind.

Mom delivered some food to dad and Lucy and sat around to observe the shop and dad.

Lucy was in the workshop too, working on something.

It seems that she was rather engrossed in whatever she was doing that she didn't notice us.

After a while, I noticed that other than mom, Lucy seemed to be the only girl here.

I wonder if she'll be ok.

Well, dad's also here so she's probably fine.

I do wonder though, how old is she actually.

She definitely looked like the youngest one here.

Oh well, I'll have plenty of time to find out in the future. 

...

Today is my first birthday.

Mom spent the whole day preparing and cooking.

By this time, I had better mobility and could move around a bunch on my own now.

Of course, I didn't year to be held by mom as much anymore these days but being left to do my own things didn't seem to be all that fun.

Andrew liked to play outside most of the time and today was no different.

I honestly don't know what he does all the time outside but it makes me rather curious.

By the time dinner rolled around, the table was full of food. 

Mom and Dad seems really happy that I had reached one year in age and cooked a bunch of different things.

Normally there'd only be 2 or sometimes 3 different frying pans full of stuff but today, there was 4.

I didn't even know we had 4 frying pans here.

That said, it seems that this family has a weird tradition.

One of the frying pans that mom uses to cook is named Pandle. 

I don't really know the story of this but I've gotten curious.

If I had the ability to talk. I'd probably ask mom about it, but right now, I don't.

I'm starting to understand the language of the people around me better already but speaking is out of the question.

I definitely don't have enough control over my breathing or throat to do anything more than baby voices.

Once I finally figure out how to speak in this body, I'll definately ask someone about it.

Maybe they'll tell me that it's a guardian of this family or something.

Haha there's no way it's something that clich√© right?

...

Today, Clover contacted me for the first time since I reincarnated.

It was around the time I had expected them to find me.

"How do you do, my lord?" was the first thing Clover said to me.

"As you can see, I'm still trying to get used to this body." I replied.

Of course, either of us spoke any words. 

Clover was the great Spirit of Shadow and I was once the demon lord whom Clover had formed a pact with.

Well, maybe a pact isn't really the correct term. 

Technically, Clover granted me a blessing which, among other things, allows me to reincarnate over and over again.

But it isn't really that one sided.

After all, we share the same goal in protecting the demons who live in this world.

"What is the current era?" I asked Clover though my soul.

"About 150 years after the end of the demon campaign."

"Oh? So my previous life actually comes after this life in the flow of time."

"Time is strange like that. Speaking of, has Enshushu contacted you yet?"

"No. Enshushu isn't really that good at finding me. I bet they haven't noticed my reincarnation yet."

"Fair enough. So what are you plans now?"

"To live this life out as a normal person like last time."

"That's good to hear."

"Let's hope that we'll never actually have to do anything other than to live ordinary peaceful lives."

"I agree."

...

Today. Clover informed me of something rather interesting.

"My lord, it seems that the frying pan named Pandle actually houses a spirit."

Cover's message surprised me so much that I stumbled and fell on my tiny little butt.

Or at least I would have if mom wasn't around to catch me.

"There there, you almost had it" she said as she smiled at me but I wasn't looking at her. 

Instead. I was looking at the frying pan behind her hanging on the roof.

"What is it doing?" I asked as soon as I regained my composure.

"Right now, I'm not too sure. It doesn't seem to be trying to do anything. Should I attempt to make contact?"

"Probably not. lets take a wait and see approach."

"Understood."

after that, I returned to my daily walking practice.

...

Today, I'm becoming a big sister.

It's been a bit over 2 years since I reincarnated.

I've gotten the hang of walking by now and I'm making good progress on talking.

My vocabulary isn't the best yet but I can at least hold up a conversation.

Of course, most of the time, I don't really talk to my family as much.

Instead, I end up talking to Clover more.

Of course, we talked about mom's big belly and were taking a guesses at when she would give birth.

Dad, and older sister are definitely in the know and has been staying home more frequently lately.

Unfortunately, dad wasn't home today.

Fortunately, however. big sister Lucy was around today. 

Big brother Andrew wasn't really any help as would be expected of a 5 year old boy.

I guess it's really up to me to help deliver.

Luckily, I've had experience assisting delivery as well as giving birth before in my previous lives.

Yet because of my current Physique, I couldn't really do anything myself.

Lucy quickly instructed Andrew to go fetch dad but I know that they wont be back for at least 2 hours. 

I'm sure he wouldn't be back in time.

Lucy went out shortly after an I was standing by mom trying to comfort her from the pain.

"Think we should help? You can use some magic." Clover suggest.

"I was thinking the same thing but I'm unsure since there's that spirit in the frying pan. We still don't know it's motives or what it's doing."

"That's fair. It's probably safer not to expose ourselves just yet."

"But I'm also worried about mom. If things goes on like this, mom might end up dying. Are you able to peak at the future for this?" I asked. 

"That would be difficult... but not impossible. But the frying pan might notice."

"The thing is, if it's able to notice your movements through time, I should have noticed both of us long ago, but it hasn't done anything yet. That and if it's able to do that, we'd have to fight it eventually. I think it's probably safe to assume it's not that much of a threat."

"Fair evaluation... I'll be right back then." Clover answered before disappearing.

But just as soon as Clover disappeared, I started picking up the presence of another Clover.

Of course, I know this isn't another Clover, this is the same clover that left for the future. but instead had returned to a few seconds before they left the current time.

"So what's the situation?" I asked.

"First off, that sprit in the frying pan is harmless. Second, mom will likely die if nothing's done. That happens in about 6 of 10 futures I looked at."

"I guess there's no need hold back then." I declared.

I grabbed hold of Mom's hand and began casting the collection of spells.

First off Hypnosis, then Teleport, then Heal.

Next up, I had to use Telekinesis to remove all the extra stuff that I grabbed out of mom with Teleport and incinerated them with the fire pit. 

Hopefully no one will notice this.

Finally, I casted Cure to remove Hypnosis from mom after placing my newly born younger sister into her arms.

Of course, this wasn't the first time I've delivered a baby and I'm sure this wont be my last.

But I'm sure this is the first time I had to do such a thing with only magic given my current physical state.

Fortunately, magic doesn't rely much on physical capabilities and instead is based on the power of the spirit who bestowed the spell and it just so happens that I have the blessings of quite a few high level sprits including Clover.

Shortly after receiving my Cure spell, mom awoken from her trance while holding my little sister.

She looked a bit confused around the room as there was no one else around but us.

"eh... eeehh... Machala what happened?" mom asked in confusion

For my part, I decided to play it cool and pretend I didn't do anything.

"hun? Baby came out of you and you picked her up." I answered as innocently as I could.

"Oh?! Oh ya! That's right!" mom answered absentmindedly.

After a while big sister Lucy came back with some of our neighbors but they were too late.

My little sister had been born already and they didn't get to do anything.

Coincidentally, Clover told me that what mattered the most in the future was when dad would return. 

So I guess the neighbors didn't help much in those futures.

"What do you think we should name your little sister?" mom asked me shortly after dad returned.

Lucy immediately came up with something but Andrew stayed quite for the most part.

For my part. I couldn't help but to see a the image of my secretary and friend of a previous life I've had as a demon lord in the newly born child.

"Kelly" I replied fully believing in this judgement.

"Hmm... I like the name Kelly too." Dad chimed in.

"Is that so? I guess that's decided then. Your name is now Kelly." Mom said smiling at mew newly born younger sister.
