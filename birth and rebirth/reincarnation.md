# Reincarnation

Today, I was born.

when is today? I don't know.

All I know is that I was born during the day.

The first person I saw when I opened my eyes was the face of a beautiful girl, the splitting image of my secretary Kelly in one of my pervious life.

More specifically, my secretary during the time when I was a serving as the demon lord.

But those times are long behind me now, or maybe in front of me. 

Time is such a strange oddity when it comes to reincarnating.

Not wanting to be too abnormal, I made a few random sounds and moved my little chubby limbs around.

Getting used to a new body is going to be tough.

This is easily one of the worst part of reincarnating.

But it is what It is.

Mom looked at me happily as she held me in her arms.

I looked around as well to scan my surrounding and noticed a man who must be my father helping out with odd jobs.

There were even two other kids around. 

One seemed to be around 6 while the other seemed to be around 3.

It seems that this time, I was born into a family of three children.

I wonder what kind of family this will be.

...

Today, I had finally figured out that my name in this life is Machala.

Trying to decipher language and sounds in the beginning of being born is rather difficult.

Everything sounds like a mess.

But there are patterns.

I guess this is what I get for getting my soul placed into such an underdeveloped body.

But at least I had figured out my name.

Though, to be honest, I was going to figure it out sooner or later anyways.

After all, it something that every baby eventually figures out.

Coincidentally, I had also figured out that in this life, I'm female.

Having lived my previous life as a male farmer toiling the fields all day, being able to take it easy as a wife just seems like a very nice change in pace.

I hope the men that live near by are decent.

Should I try to play a hand in making sure the kids around me grow up into decent people or should I keep to myself and let them develop naturally and hope for the best?

... Well I don't have to make any decision about this now.

There's plenty of time in the future to figure this out.

Maybe someone will even catch my eye as a kid and we'll get married after we grow up and so on.

That sounds so romantic.

Fresh new life, fresh new start.

...

Today, mom took me outside for the first time.

I've only been alive for 2 just over weeks at this point but Mom decided that she was going to take me out with her today.

I was strapped to her chest and my elder brother came with us as well.

My elder sister went out with dad early in the morning so I'm not too sure sure what she was doing.

Mom was carrying a bunch of dirty cloths with her when we went out today so I had an idea of what we were going to do.

When we arrived, mom handed me and my elder brother to another person and took off to wash the cloths with a whole group of other women around.

This was also a pretty common practice in my previous life but kept looking at her despite knowing this anyways.

The adult who was with me said some incomprehensible things to me some time ago but I didn't care for her.

Instinctively, I just wanted to look at mom. 

I longed for her to return, to be held once more, but there wasn't much I could do.

I know that it will happen eventually, but the longing wont go away.

It really sucks being in a baby's body.

...

Today, I met some of my neighbors.

The village we lived in was small and houses were somewhat spread apart.

I could see some fields for growing crops during the times when mom took me out but it definitely wasn't much.

I had guessed that our family wasn't the farming type which was cool but I wonder what they did.

Dad would go out every day and come home every evening. 

He'd talk about stuff with mom after dinner but my language skills in this body had not yet developed enough to be able to understand anything they were saying.

On the other hand, mom would often take me out with her but this time, it wasn't to the usual laundry session.

Instead, it seemed to be just a normal hangout.

Dad was here too and so was many of others men from around the village.

Actually, I recognize quite a few of the faces from the laundry sessions.

It seems that this was just a gathering of the local neighbors. 

It seems that each household's whole family was present.

I know ours was.

The kids were more or less grouped ourselves by age and started having fun by ourselves.

Of course, I wasn't old enough too do that and instead, spent the whole event being held in mom's arms.

Of course, that was perfectly fine by me, there's no where else in the world I'd rather be.

Though with that being the case, I was still looking around at the other kids and the adults.

None of them struck me as anything special.

...

Today I fount out what My dad did every day.

Mom took me and elder brother Andrew to see dad and elder sister Lucy.

We came to a place that stank of sweaty old men, burning metal and wood dust.

It was a rather unpleasant place. 

But just one glance told me that this place was a crafting workshop of some kind.

Mom delivered some food to dad and Lucy and sat around to observe the shop and dad.

Lucy was in the workshop too, working on something.

It seems that she was rather engrossed in whatever she was doing that she didn't notice us.

After a while, I noticed that other than mom, Lucy seemed to be the only girl here.

I wonder if she'll be ok.

Well, dad's also here so she's probably fine.

I do wonder though, how old is she actually.

She definitely looked like the youngest one here.

Oh well, I'll have plenty of time to find out in the future.
