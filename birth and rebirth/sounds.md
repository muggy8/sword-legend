# Sounds

Today, mom sang a song for me.

It's definately not the first time it happened but it's the first time I recognized the sounds for what it was, a song.

I felt stupid for not realizing this unit now since I had always though that she was talking at me or talking to nothing in particular.

But today, I finally noticed the rhythm in her voice.

Of course, I still have no idea what she's saying but that'll come later.

I also don't recognize the exact song that mom was singing either.

Then again, given that I could be reincarnated into any era within any culture, it's little wonder I don't recognize anything.

But even without recognizing the song, I really do enjoy this melody.

I should probably remember this song so one day, I can sing it for my children.

I guess I have plenty of time to repair for that so I guess I don't really need to worry too much about it just now.

Instead, I should just be enjoying life as an infant.

Life's good.

...

Today, I experienced thunder and lightning for the first time in this life.

Experiencing a thunderstorm is somewhat like a landmark for me.

Every time I'm reincarnated into a new body, I have to readjust myself to the senses of a new body.

Lightning strikes are kind of like an anchor to help me adjust.

Of course, each lightning and thunder are different from each other but they're largely the same.

The flash of the lightning followed by the boom of the thunder helps me translate what I would expect to experience in another body with what I'm currently experiencing.

It's definately not a perfect translation but it's something.

Luckily for me, I am able to craw around now which means I could spend the entire storm sitting by the window looking outside.

At least that would have been the plan but the wooden windows were close.

The most I could do is to wait for the flash of light to peak thought the creases of the window and the roar of the thunder that would come soon after too.

I wonder how normal infants would react to thunderstorms. 

Oh well.

...

Today, I was sick.

I felt discomfort all over my body and my mind felt hazy.

Breathing was more difficult than before and my apatite wasn't very good.

Mom tried to feed me multiple times but the milk that came out of her breasts tasted murky with a unpleasant chewy texture.

But the worst part is the feeling of coldness.

Everything around me felt cold.

Mom felt cold, the blankets felt cold, even my own fingers felt cold.

I probably cried and screamed just like a normal baby but I couldn't remember it.

I was too busy being assaulted by the feeling of discomfort and coldness that radiated from every part of my body.

I hated this.

At one point, I was pretty sure I'd die.

But it seemed like fate had other plans.

By the time my discomfort subsided and I could once again observe the world around me, I was greeted by exhausted looks all around me.

Mom was holding on to me, Dad seemed unconscious on the floor with my elder siblings close by.

I don't know how long I had been sick for but I could tell everyone was exhausted from taking care of me.

Seeing this, I had realized that this family I had been born into was special.

I've died as an infant so many times in my endless reincarnation that I had fully expected to perish today but instead, I didn't.

It made me glad.

I hope this family becomes a successful and healthy bloodline.

...

Today, I was mesmerized by fire.

The fire mom uses to cook.

I don't know why but I decided to look at the fire in the fire pit.

It probably reminded me of the spirit of fire.

The spirit of fire and I didn't have the best of relationships in the past but things got better over time.

I was the demon lord and the protector of the demons and the spirit of fire was the guardian of the humans.

Of course we started off with an antagonistic relationship.

But we settled our differences and made an agreement.

Now our relationship is closer to that of rivals than that of enemies.

The spirit of fire still wants the best for humanity and I still want the best for the demons.

Because of the similarities between the humans and demons, the two sides would often find themselves in conflict with each other.

The spirit of fire wants the humans to win in these conflicts and I want the demons to win.

It was pretty simple.

But regardless of what neither the humans nor the demons would go extinct.

I would ensure the survival of the demons and the spirit of fire would ensure the survival of humans.

That's why we can both agree that as long as humans and demons both exist, then it's in both of our best interest to work together to ensure relative peace between the two groups.

That's why now, I'd say our relationship is closer to that of competitive rivals than that of sworn enemies.

We both respect each other but we both value our own goals.

We'll help each other out as long as it doesn't hurt our own cause.

At the end of the day, as long as there's balance, things should be fine.

...

Today, I realized that I will probably survive to see my first birthday.

I've already existed in this world for almost 10 months at this point and it doesn't seem like anything bad is going to happen.

If things continue as they have been up to now, I might actually get to see myself growing up again.

This is something that doesn't happen all the time.

I'd say about half the time. I end up reincarnating into situations where I'd die before I even reach the age of one.

I guess I got lucky and I can actually think about the future for real now.

I wonder what I should do with this life.

Then again, I doubt I should think that far ahead.

I think I only reach adulthood about 1 in every 10 times.

In fact, I had set the threshold for being able to count a life as notable at the point where I am able to communicate with others.

It sounds like a rather low bar to clear but I've died so many times before my body and mind developed to the point of being able to communicate that I've learned to just accept things as they come until that point. 

No reason to be bothered by any of this and no reason to put in any effort until then.

But still, my first birthday in this body.

Something about that sounds rather nice.

It'd be nice to live an actual life twice in a row.

Hopefully bad luck doesn't strike any time soon. 

Preferably, bad luck doesn't strike at all.
