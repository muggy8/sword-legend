# Sounds

Today, mom sang a song for me.

It's definately not the first time it happened but it's the first time I recognized the sounds for what it was, a song.

I felt stupid for not realizing this unit now since I had always though that she was talking at me or talking to nothing in particular.

But today, I finally noticed the rhythm in her voice.

Of course, I still have no idea what she's saying but that'll come later.

I also don't recognize the exact song that mom was singing either.

Then again, given that I could be reincarnated into any era within any culture, it's little wonder I don't recognize anything.

But even without recognizing the song, I really do enjoy this melody.

I should probably remember this song so one day, I can sing it for my children.

I guess I have plenty of time to repair for that so I guess I don't really need to worry too much about it just now.

Instead, I should just be enjoying life as an infant.

Life's good.

...

Today, I experienced thunder and lightning for the first time in this life.

Experiencing a thunderstorm is somewhat like a landmark for me.

Every time I'm reincarnated into a new body, I have to readjust myself to the senses of a new body.

Lightning strikes are kind of like an anchor to help me adjust.

Of course, each lightning and thunder are different from each other but they're largely the same.

The flash of the lightning followed by the boom of the thunder helps me translate what I would expect to experience in another body with what I'm currently experiencing.

It's definately not a perfect translation but it's something.

Luckily for me, I am able to craw around now which means I could spend the entire storm sitting by the window looking outside.

At least that would have been the plan but the wooden windows were close.

The most I could do is to wait for the flash of light to peak thought the creases of the window and the roar of the thunder that would come soon after too.

I wonder how normal infants would react to thunderstorms. 

Oh well.

...

Today, someone I didn't recognize was carrying me.

Of course, mom was around too so it made me less nervous but it always feels unsettling when someone I don't know carries me.

In fact, even when my elder sister carries me, it feels unsettling.

But today, it was another adult.

I probably know this person but I cant remember.

It's one of those days that mom would take the laundry with her and my elder brother with her to the community laundry area.

Instead of dropping me off in the babies area right away, she talked to someone else and then handed me to that person.

I wasn't sure what was happening but mom took me back shortly after and brought me over to the babies area.

I tried not to make a big fuss about being in someone else's hands but It was just too uncomfortable.

By now, I had gotten used to being with the other babies since we come here at least twice a week if not more.

I'd also like to think that I've gotten to know the other babies but honestly, I have no idea who they are.

They all sort of look the same.

I'm surprised that our parents could tell us apart at all.

Then again, we are wearing different things so that makes distinguishing us trivial but if it wasn't for that fact, I wonder if our parents could tell us apart.

The thought of getting taken home by a stranger thinking I'm their child was terrifying to think about. 

I should probably avoid such thoughts.

...

Today, I was mesmerized by fire.

The fire mom uses to cook.

I don't know why but I decided to look at the fire in the fire pit.

It probably reminded me of the spirit of fire.

The spirit of fire and I didn't have the best of relationships in the past but things got better over time.

I was the demon lord and the protector of the demons and the spirit of fire was the guardian of the humans.

Of course we started off with an antagonistic relationship.

But we settled our differences and made an agreement.

Now our relationship is closer to that of rivals than that of enemies.

The spirit of fire still wants the best for humanity and I still want the best for the demons.

Because of the similarities between the humans and demons, the two sides would often find themselves in conflict with each other.

The spirit of fire wants the humans to win in these conflicts and I want the demons to win.

It was pretty simple.

But regardless of what neither the humans nor the demons would go extinct.

I would ensure the survival of the demons and the spirit of fire would ensure the survival of humans.

That's why we can both agree that as long as humans and demons both exist, then it's in both of our best interest to work together to ensure relative peace between the two groups.

That's why now, I'd say our relationship is closer to that of competitive rivals than that of sworn enemies.

We both respect each other but we both value our own goals.

We'll help each other out as long as it doesn't hurt our own cause.

At the end of the day, as long as there's balance, things should be fine.
