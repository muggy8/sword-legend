# **Lucy**

"Hello Miss Maria, how are you doing today?"

The one who spoke those words was a particular Roland who I remember seeing once.

Roland was somehow related to Johan and it was pretty clear that Roland was Johan's superior of some kind.

But that's about all I know.

Today, he wasn't sitting at the table like last time, instead, he was standing at the door.

And unlike last time, I wasn't on the table.

Instead I was hanging from the roof.

Johan, himself, had already left for The Workshop earlier and other than Machala and Kelly, everyone else was outside.

"Oh my, Sir Roland. What brings you all the way out here on this busy day? Please come in and have a rest. I'll prepare something for you to drink." Maria responded immediately upon realizing who was at the door.

"Thank you very much, Miss Maria but a drink wouldn't be necessary. I have something important I must discuss with you."

With that, Roland came in and sat himself by the table and Maria did the same after closing the door.

"So what is it that you have to discuss with me?"

Maria's voice sounded uneasy and anxious.

"It's about Lucy. She's about to turn 16 soon right?"

"Yes."

"Don't you think she should stop coming to the workshop? She'll be of marrying age soon and it doesn't seem like you've been teaching any mothering skills. I'm worried about here."

"..."

"Maria, I think you know that I treat everyone in my workshop like family regardless of who they are and where they came from. It hurts my heart to see Lucy at the workshop every day. If this continues, she'll never be able to marry without any mothering skills at all."

"..."

"Maria, as Lucy's mother, you must also know this feeling right? I do admit that she's got talent, but her duty to the family, your family, is first and foremost as a mother."

"..."

"Please Maria, say something..."

"I... I know..."

Maria's voice was shaky, uneasy.

"I know... my duty to my family is also that of a mother. And as a mother, I don't want to take away my children's happiness."

"..."

"I decided this long ago when Johan and I moved here. That no matter what our children decide to do, we would allow it. If our sons want to learn the housekeeping skills, we'll allow it, if our daughters want to learn blacksmithing, we'll allow it. This is our way of being the best mother and father we could. Lucy has decided that she enjoys the life of a blacksmith then we'll just have to quietly accept it."

"Maria, this is admirable but please think about this properly. What will happen in 10 years? What will happen in 20 years? If Lucy continues down the path, she'll never be able to be a mother. Doesn't that sadden you?"

"I... I know... I've talked about this many times with Johan. But we ultimately decided that this was for the best."

"Then what would happen if you sons decided to take up housekeeping? What would happen to them? They would never be able to marry. You could never form a household with 2 housekeepers and no one providing for the household."

"..."

"Likewise, there's no way having 2 providers in the household would allow a household to raise children. Maria, please, you, of all people, should know how difficult it is to raise children."

"..."

"I'm worried about Lucy's future. Will you reconsider your decision? Please?"

"I..."

The room became silent.

It was as if Roland and Maria were the only ones in the room and nothing else existed.

It was only Roland, Maria, and the table that stood between them.

Roland looked Maria in the eye with a stern determined look.

Maria looked back at him with uneasiness.

It was clear as day to see who was in control of the situation.

Yet despite this obvious situation, The words that Maria and Roland spoke betrayed the atmosphere.

"I... can not... I can not change Lucy's path."

"Miss Maria! Do you not understand! I'm concerned about her as well!"

"I know Sir Roland. I know. But still. As a mother, I cannot trample on my children's happiness like this. Even if it's better in the long run, I don't want my children to experience what I have experienced, to be denied and forced into doing something I hate. As a mother, I simply cannot put my children through that kind of experience."

"..."

"You see, as a child. I didn't enjoy house keeping. I wanted to be with my father. He was the one of the elder blacksmiths of the town I grew up in. I wanted to be just like him and create things. I would carve sticks as a kid and make toys for all the other kids around the village. I thought those days would continue and I would be able to continue doing that with my father in his workshop when I grew older. But he forbade me from doing that. He didn't even let me go to the workshop. I hated him for that, for killing my dream and killing my happiness. There was a long time in the past that I resented him for that decision. It's why Johan and I came to this town. Honestly, I still do. That's why Johan and I had decided that we would never do that with our children."

By the time that Maria had finished, it was clear that she was on the verge of tears.

"Miss Maria..."

Roland's voice had become softer.

All the momentum he had before was gone.

Sound returned to the room.

Machala and Kelly existed in the room once more.

"I'm sorry for coming here today with such an unreasonable request." Roland sighed.

He stood up after this and left the room, closing the door.

Maria's head was facing down and her hair covered her face.

And then, a drop of something fell from her face, then another.

It wasn't until now that I realized that I had transferred myself into the table as more drops of clear liquid continued to fall onto the table that I currently reside in.
