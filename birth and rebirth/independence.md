# **Independence**

I was once again, sitting on a fire when I woke up this time.

However, this time, something was weird.

I was no longer in a room.

There wasn't a roof above me as far as I could tell.

Around me were strange structures that resembled the stuff Maria or Mom would put into the fire when they were doing this thing called "cooking".

The only thing I found familiar around me was Maria.

Well Johan as well but I still didn't like him.

Fortunately, he wasn't an annoying brat like another person I knew.

For some reason, everything was incredibly bright as well.

There was light everywhere and everything was extremely colorful.

Maria's normal everyday clothes seemed so much more beautiful with all this light.

Even Johan seemed beautiful too despite his bulky appearance.

Somewhere close by was this other table like structure with a strange 4 legged creature connected to it.

This table looking thing seemed to have circles instead of legs and I found that odd.

Everything I've seen thus far has had straight sturdy looking legs.

But this thing defies all of that.

Circle legs, how strange.

What's even more strange is the fact that there's a bunch of stuff placed on it.

I've never seen a table packed so full before.

I wonder if Maria or Johan are ok when they decided to put everything onto this strange circle legged table.

The strange 4 legged being that the circle legged table is attached too seems rather disturbing looking as well.

It had the same bulky strong look as Johan and the annoying brat.

I didn't like it by association.

But then again, Johan doesn't seem that bad so maybe this 4 legged creature would be fine as well?

Who knows.

"Why do you only cook with Pandle?" Johan asked.

"It's a gift from mom, of course I'd cook with it."

"I mean that's true, but we're out here in the middle of nowhere. Why are you still cooking with something this heavy? Wouldn't it be much easier if you used something else?"

"Well... that's true... But I just find it comforting to cook with Pandle. I don't know."

"I see. Is that so?"

Maria continued to stir the stuff in my container as Johan changed the subject.

"It's going to take another 3 days to get to Reed village it seems. I can't wait to ditch this traveling lifestyle"

"Yah. I didn't expect traveling to be this taxing on the body."

"I know right? I have a newfound respect for those traveling merchants."

"Exactly. I thought they were just mean spirited goons selling common things from other towns and villages for much more than what the items were worth. I guess if you think about how hard it is to get from there to here, it's not that unreasonable."

"I heard that some of them even get attacked by bandits while traveling and have to hire bodyguards. I think one of the clients we've had at the workshop was one of those bodyguards."

"Hmm?"

"Well he only showed up once but he left a strong impression. He had a rather interesting request for us to polish and sharpen a sword he had. He said he wanted the sword to be sharpened as a single smooth curve from the flat of the sword all the way down to the edge of the blade. I think I spent like 3 days grinding the sword before I passed it along to one of the other smiths."

"That sounds really annoying and difficult."

"Ha ha ya it was. But let's be honest here, you have no idea what I'm talking about do you?"

"Nope. Not a single clue."

Johan responded with a sigh and a shrug at Maria's comment but he didn't seem angry or upset.

Instead, he grabbed a small container nearby and started filling it with the contents of my container.

"Hay! It's not cooked yet!" Maria shouted.

"It looks plenty done to me." Johan refuted.

"Don't blame me if you end up feeling sick after."

"I can't possibly get sick eating your cooking." Johan said with a big smile on his face before he started consuming whatever he got from my container.

...

"Pandle! Pandle, Pandle!"

A loud shouting sound woke me up once more.

I was once again in a small room.

Maria was standing close by but there was no fire.

There was also this small being that Maria was holding on to in the same way that Mom held onto her when she was around the same size.

"Mama. Tha! Tha!" the small thing shouted while pointing at a pointy stick.

"That? That is a knife."

"Gniffy! Gniff!"

Maria giggled at the mini Maria's remarks.

"Oh Lucy, you're so cute." Maria replied before going off with Lucy to the other side of the room.

Even though this room felt familiar, I could tell it was different somehow.

Maybe it's the way that stuff is located, maybe the color of the walls, maybe it's something else but the room felt different.

Last time, I woke up in a place without a room, and this time, I woke up in a room that just felt wrong.

And there's another annoying brat now.

At least Maria is still here, that's good.

Pretty soon, Maria came back over with Lucy now snuggly strapped to her chest with some kind of cloth.

I remember seeing this somewhere before.

"Mama! Mama! Pandle! Pandle!" Lucy shouted as Maria set fire to the sticks beneath me before going away to somewhere else.

Before long, the same action that has been performed on me countless times repeated themselves once more.

Sticky liquid goes in first, then random chunks of something, stir stir stir, then more liquids and powder until I get taken out of the flames and placed onto a table.

Once again, It was Johan and Maria who were sitting by the table I was on.

Lucy was there too of course.

"How's things at the workshop?" Maria asked as she placed Lucy down onto the table in front of her.

"Things are going alright I guess. They could be better but I could tell the master here isn't as skilled as your father."

"That's interesting."

"I bet you had no idea how skilled your father is."

"Of course I don't. He drives me away from the workshop every time."

"What a pity. Oh right, It seems like I'll be taking on an apprentice soon."

"For real? You haven't even been at the workshop for 2 years and they're already giving you an apprentice to work with?"

"The workshop master seems to think I'm skilled enough and knowledgeable enough for this but I still feel like I'm still an apprentice."

"I know that feeling. I remember cooking for someone else for the first time without mom around watching over what I was doing. I felt nervous and unsure if I would be good enough. But it turned out fine so I'm sure you'll be fine too."

"Haha... Thanks dear, I'll try to remember that when I start working with my apprentice."

"I believe in you. You can do it!"

"Do ee!! Do ee!!" Lucy shouted at the end.
