# **Roland**

I wonder how long has it been since Johan replaced Dad and Maria replaced Mom?

The two even talk like Mom and Dad now.

I don't even know how many times I woke up and Johan and Maria were the only big people around.

However, today seemed somewhat different.

it was more than Maria, Johan and Lucy, instead, there were these 2 other people around.

One was another small person who you could probably almost fit into my container.

The other was another bulky person who was slightly smaller than Johan.

Yet despite his size, he seemed to be someone who had seen more days than Johan.

The other thing that was weird about today is that I wasn't the only pan on the table today.

Beside me was another one.

We looked alike in some ways but quite different in others.

Johan was scoping stuff out of the other pan and into small containers in front of each of Maria, the new buky guy and Lucy.

Lucy herself has gotten bigger and much better at speaking now.

"I only want whatever's in Pandle" Lucy pouted.

"You know, it's not good to be picky with food, Lucy" replied Johan.

"Lucy, can you be a good girl for mommy today please. If you do, I'll make you your favorite potato stew tomorrow." smiled Maria.

"... Fine."

After Johan scooped something into the 4 smaller containers from the other pan, he then started scoping stuff out from my container.

After he was done, he sat back down.

Lucy was already eating her portion by the time Johan sat down.

"So what brings you here to our humble estate today, sir Roland" Maria asked once Johan had sat down.

"It's about Joe, Johan's apprentice. I want to get his opinion on him." replied this Roland guy.

"Oh I see." Johan replied.

"I've been told by the town Diviner that Johan's apprentice, Joe, is supposedly from another kingdom and he's here to learn about our craft. Though what they're aiming for seems rather unknown. That's why I placed him under Johan since he's the newest member of our workshop." Roland explained.

"Are you serious? And here I thought I was being recognized for my skills." Johan Lemented.

"Hahahaha. Don't worry. I can tell you're skilled. In fact I'm pretty sure that you studied under someone much more skilled than I before we met. However, you still have much to learn, as do I."

"..."

"Back to the primary business here. Johan, have you discovered anything out of the ordinary about Joe?"

"Hmm... Well I don't really know much about him."

"Then what kind of stuff do you two talk about?"

"I mean, it's mostly about the things we're making and the details of how to craft it. Most of the things we talk about seem like ordinary questions any apprentice would ask."

"Hmm... Is that so."

"What about you miss Maria? What of your interactions with Joe during your frequent workshop visits."

"Well, for me, he seemed rather suspicious of me whenever I brought lunch for Johan and the others. We don't talk much but he never eats anything I bring to the workshop."

"I see. I see."

"There was once when I tried to strike up a conversation with him. I asked him how Johan's tutelage and he said something along the lines of 'I've had better'. I remember I told Johan about it that night and he seemed really down."

"Oh ya, that's right. I remember that time. I felt really bad about my skills for the whole week after."

"Is there anything else?" Roland asked.

"Hmm..."

Both Maria and Johan both fell into thought at Roland's question.

Roland took this time to eat the food in his container.

"I don't know if this counts for anything but when he first started. I asked him what was he most passionate about crafting and he replied with 'weapons 'with barely any thought. I didn't give it much thought at the time but if he is really from another kingdom here to spy on us, it'd make sense that he's only interested in weapons."

"Don't most craftsmen want to make weapons?" Maria asked, feeling a bit surprised by what Johan had just said.

"That is... true... to an extent... It's just that when you're a weapon smith, you lose much of your freedom and become a part of the kingdom's royal craftsmen. Everyone wants to be a royal craftsman as it comes with significant benefits. It's just that being a weaponsmith is the easiest way to become a royal craftsman for the average craftsmen." Roland replied.

Johan didn't say much in response to Roland's reply.

"I see... Johan, do you want to be one of those royal craftsmen?"

"I'm... not sure..."

"It's probably best that you don't. You have the potential to achieve even greater heights by not being a royal craftsman... That is if you work hard at your trade hahahaha." Roland laughed as he slapped Johan's back.

"Master Roland!" Johan complained.

"Johan, I have something I need you two do. I need to cast a few enchantments on you in order to investigate Joe. As for you miss Maria, I need to cast some enchantment on you as well. Think of this as a protection of sorts. Will the two of you agree to this?"

"Oh um... I guess it cant hurt. What kind of enchantment are we talking about here?" Johan answered.

"Forgetfulness and Thought Protection for both of you."

"Oh enchantments! I never thought I'd experience something like that." Maria said in excitement.

"I think we don't actually have any say in this matter, correct?" Johan sighed.

"Hahahaha, don't make it sound so depressing. Just think of it as doing a favor for someone who you can't turn down."

"I guess that's fine then."

"We're all in agreement then?"

Maria and Johan nodded to Rolland's question.

"Well, let's begin."

With Roland's words, he took out a strange looking chunk of metal attached to some string and started swinging it in front of Maria.

"Miss Maria, you'll be the first to receive the enchantment. I need you to focus all of your attention on this swinging pendulum while listening to my words. Then at the right time, we'll recite a prayer together."

"Alright."

"Now focus, focus as much as you can onto this pendulum. See its motion, feel its movement, ignore everything around you besides the swinging pendulum alone..."
