# **My First Memories**

My first memories in this world started with someone shouting "Pandle!" at me.

I would later recognize this action as a small child pointing at me but at the time, I didn't really know anything nor did I feel anything.

My second memory was another being replying "Pan handle. !@-2# 9$^2@$y 42*r737." to the small child.

I didn't know why but for some reason, the sound "Pan handle" stuck with me.

It wasn't until much later that I realized that "Pan handle" is what the part of my body the people use to hold me is called.

There were many blanks in my memories in these early days and I would later recognize that my consciousness would exist for a few minutes to hours between months to years of unconsciousness.

I realized this because each time I'd awaken, the people, the people around me would be slightly different yet still recognizable.

Today was one of those days.

"You're a strange one mom, why'd you name a frying pan?" asked one of the smaller people standing around me.

"It's actually a funny story. Apparently, when I was a baby, I called it Pandle while I was trying to say pan handle and I refused to call it anything else. Before I knew it, everyone called this frying pan Pandle."

"Then what if I named it something else?"

"Then Pandle would have 2 names. But the other name isn't going to be used all that much because everyone already calls it Pandle."

"Awww, so I can't rename Pandle?"

"Well you can try. But I think it'll be very hard to rename something that already has a name."

"What if we lend it to our neighbors and they call it something else? Then wouldn't they name Pandle to something else?"

"Well, people don't really name their tools. So I think the name Pandle will just disappear."

"That's so sad, how could we make sure everyone in the future knows that this frying pan is named Pandle?"

"Good question. Maybe dad knows the answer. You should try asking him."

"Alright!"

...

"Who knew raising a child would be this much work. It gives me doubts about the one I'm carrying now..."

...

Before I knew it, I was being lifted by my pan handle into another room where the small child from earlier was and another larger person.

"It's dinner time~" the one holding on to me said.

"Oh, Thank you dear. Jimmy, go sit at the table."

"Ok Dad!"

When I finally felt a solid surface beneath me once more, the 3 people were sitting around me.

This was a scene that came up often in my memories.

Sometimes, there were many more people, sometimes there were less.

One that I remember most clearly from those days was the few times where the one known as "mom" was alone sitting next to me with liquid rolling down from her eyes.

The surroundings beyond the ones known as mom, dad, and Jimmy would change every now and then but it's always times like these when I would wake up.

"Why are you cooking with Pandle again?" Dad asked.

"It's barely enough for the 3 of us. We'll definitely not be able to feed everyone just cooking in Pandle once our next child arrives." he continued as he scooped something from me into a container in his hand.

"I know I know. But the other pans just don't work as well. They're super hard to clean and food always gets stuck to the surface of those pans."

"Maybe if you name the other pans, they'll become magical like Pandle!" suggested Jimmy.

"I don't know, but I'd like to think it's because grandma is still watching over me and doing her best to take care of us from above." Mom answered back completely ignoring Jimmy's suggestion.

...

The next time I woke up. I was resting on a flat surface.

Dad was next to me and Jimmy was grabbing my pan handle and making marks on it with something.

The room we were in was completely different from the place where I usually remember.

For some reason, Mom wasn't around this time which was a bit strange but there's nothing I can do about it.

Before long, Dad spoke up "Good job Jimmy, you wrote Pandle correctly."

"I'm a genius right!"

"Definitely!"

"Now, people will always know that this is Pandle!"

"Exactly! Now go help mom ok. I'll show you two a surprise tonight."

"Alright!"

After his reply, Jimmy jumped off of Dad's and ran towards the door of this room.

Dad, too, got up from where he was and walked over to the door and closed it before returning to me, and moved me to another place within the room.

Once here, he placed my pan handle into a fire for a short while before pulling me back out and started hammering into a tool he placed on my pan handle.

Each time he struck the tool, I could feel a part of my pan handle changing shape.

It wasn't an unwelcome feeling but it did feel very strange.

...

The next time I woke up, Mom was standing next to me once more.

This time, there was another small person she was carrying with some kind of cloth tied around her upper body.

Jimmy was nowhere to be seen and there were clear liquids falling out of mom's eyes.

I didn't know what this meant but I felt a bit of sadness whenever mom looked like this.

"Pandle... I'm going to cook Jimmy's favorite food today... I'm sorry but this might be the last meal Jimmy will get from both of us."

I didn't know what Mom was talking about but there wasn't much I could do so I just accepted whatever Mom said.

After Mom was done cooking whatever she was cooking, she took me to the yard where Dad was standing.

In the ground there was a small rock with strangely shaped indents.

Beside it was a small container.

Mom poured the contents I was holding into the small container and set me down beside the small stone with strange indents on the ground.

"Jimmy, I brought you your favorite food. Look, Pandle is here to see you off too." Mom said softly.

I could feel drops of liquid hitting the ground behind me.

It was clear that Mom wasn't feeling too well.

After all, Jimmy is nowhere near by.

After her soft words, Dad drew closer to Mom to hold on to her.

Before long, Mom and Dad returned me to the room where I would normally wake up once more.

I didnâ€™t know it at the time but the next time I wake up once more, it will be many years into the future.
