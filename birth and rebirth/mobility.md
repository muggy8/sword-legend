# **Mobility**

Andrew has gotten bigger, not by much, but noticeably bigger.

He could talk more effectively as well now.

The only reason I have noticed these changes at all is because I've spent all my effort focusing on him.

Ever since the last time I somehow shifted myself into him, I haven't been able to experience the same thing again.

I spent every waking moment trying to shift my perspective onto him but nothing worked up to now.

However, something very odd happened today.

As I was looking around the room waiting for Andrew to come back, I found myself inside another container with a Pan Handle.

I could tell because my body had the strange symbols carved into it and the body I am currently inhabiting did not have those carvings.

I almost instinctively jumped back to my proper body but I managed to stop myself.

Instead, I decided to spend as much time as I could in the body of another container with a Pan Handle in the hopes that I would be able to learn the secret to moving between objects.

Fortunately, the experience of being a different container wasn't all too different from being Pandle.

I just dangled from the roof as I watched the happenings in the room.

Maria would be In and out of the room quite often.

The room when it's flooded with light was extremely different from the room while it was dark.

Although it's the same room, the feeling was entirely different.

Maria and Andrew were coming and going all the time, sometimes carrying things, other times they weren't.

Lucy was nowhere to be seen.

And Machala was always around watching over Kelly.

Everything felt so active and lively.

Yet everyone here becomes still as a rock once darkness takes hold of the room.

I spent the whole day observing the comings and goings of everyone until something familiar started happening.

Maria took my body from the roof and placed it in the fire pit.

I immediately recognized this as the beginning of the cooking ritual.

But today, I get to observe this action from the roof instead.

I watched intently as Maria started splitting some blobby looking objects with a strange paddle-like tool.

Machala was there too, helping out.

Before long, there was a large pile made of bits and pieces of the split apart blobby object.

Maria then started instructing Machala on how to put liquid into my body's container, on how to place the pieces of the blob into my body's container, and on how to stir the contents of my body's container.

It was all things I was intimately familiar with.

Actions that, I'm sure, Maria inherited from Mom.

Before long, Machala came to grab me from the roof and repeated the process once more and before long, I found myself resting in the fire right next to my body.

Machala's performance of the cooking ritual was different from Maria's.

This was something I could tell by feel.

The way she stirred the contents was different from Maria.

The amount of force she would use was different.

Even the Rhythm was different.

Soon enough, I was once again on the table surrounded by the family.

Johan and Lucy came back.

Andrew and Machala were sitting by the table with an eager look in their eyes.

Kelly was in Maria's arms just like every other day, the scoping began and before the scooping could finish, some of the food was already being consumed.

Machala was quite calm as always.

Lucy seemed rather satisfied.

And Andrew looks like he's really enjoying the products of this cooking ritual.

It's almost like he's completely absorbed in the eating process.

I wonder what eating feels like.

Does it feel good?

Why do some people do it eagerly like Andrew while others don't really do much.

I looked at the bow in Andrew's hands as I watched him eat.

It looked like he was having such a fun time.

I really do wonder what it feels like to eat.

"More!" Andrew shouted as He finished eating whatever he had in his bow and lifted it towards Maria.

"Sure Sure" Maria replied as she scooped more of the contents form my body's container into the bow before returning it to Andrew.

As soon as Maria's hand retracted from Andrew's bow, he began eating happily once again.

As soon as the food entered his mouth, I felt a strange sensation.

Something I've never felt before.

I couldn't describe it but it was very pleasant.

That's when I realized that I was now inhabiting Andrew's body and I could feel everything he felt.

How!?

How did it happen again?

I didn't know, but I savored the moment.

So this is the result of the cooking ritual.

I've experienced cooking so many times as Pandle but this is the first time I've experienced the results of the ritual.

As Andrew consumed the food, I was overwhelmed by the sensation of eating.

But just as suddenly as it started, everything ended.

"Thanks mom!" Andrew yelled before running away from the table towards the door taking me with him.

As he ran, I instinctively tried to return my body but I stopped myself in the last moment.

I don't know why or how, but I am currently inhabiting Andrew's body.

Who knows when I'll be able to do this again.

And it's not like Andrew wont return.

So I stuck by him as he left the room and into an open expanse.

Everything around was bright, much brighter than the room I had gotten so familiar with.

I only remember experiencing something like this once.

There was no roof as far as the eye can see and instead of a roof was a bright orange colored vastness that I could barely comprehend.

As Andrew ran around, I continued to gaze at and take in the surroundings.

The floor beneath us was sometimes green and sometimes brown.

Yet almost fast as this all started, it all ended.

Before I could take in the scene anymore, I was once again, back in the body of Pandle.

Somehow, I was back in the body of Pandle, in the dark room that I was so familiar with.

Maria and Johan were talking about something sitting over the table once more.

Machala and Lucy were off to the side taking care of Kelly.

Realizing what just happened, I couldn't help but be filled with disappointment.

Why?

Why did I end up back here again?

I wanted to see the place outside those doors some more.

It was so beautiful, so new.

I wanted to be there again, to take in the view.

I couldn't help but be filled up with sadness as I stayed motionless on the table I know so well with the family I have spent so much time with.

I wonder when I'll be able to leave this room again.
