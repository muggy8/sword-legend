# Steps

Today, Kelly took her first steps. 

Prior to today, Kelly has always crawled on all 4's but today, Kelly stood up and walked on both of her legs. 

She wasn't very good at it and fell over relatively quickly, but she did manage to take a couple steps herself before she fell.

I was amused by this.

I didn't know how or when but Lucy, Andrew and Machala all started walking sometime between the times I would wake up.

But this time, I was awake to see the moment when a person stops crawling and starts walking.

Of course, it wasn't just Kelly getting better at moving around but I was getting better at moving around as well.

I am now able to transfer myself between objects much more frequently than before.

Instead of getting a movement randomly once every time I woke up, I would be able to get at least on successful transfer every time I woke up.

I still didn't know how this worked but I was pretty sure that this had something to do with trying to see things from another thing's perspective.

Focus was clearly not the way to go. In fact, focusing seemed to make it harder to move around.

Instead, transfer myself into other things was easier when I'm focusing and just letting my mind wonder 

This was something I had discovered recently.

Today was no different from any other waking days as I tried to move myself to something else.

Instead of focusing on any one particular thing, I was trying my best to just let my mind flow from things to things and see what happens.

All I know is transfers often happen when I don't really notice and transfers.

Though most of the time, I can't really control where I transfer to.

But it's often something somewhat close by but something across the room also seem to happen every now and then as well.

That's why, recently, I've been trying to figure that out the secret to controlling where I transfer to since I've been able to transfer more frequently now.

That said, It's not like I'm able to freely control when I transfer either. 

It just happens much more frequently now ever since I noticed the situations of when transfers happen.

That's why I've been trying to recreate those situations as much as I can.

If I was able to control where I transfer to, would I be able to transfer into other people more frequently?

Ever since the time I got to see the orange colored outside world from Andrew's perspective, I had always wanted to experience that again.

Unfortunately, in order to do that, I'd need to master the ability to move around first.

That's why today, too, I'm also looking out for what happens when I transfer as I attempt to figure out how to control it.

It seems that the best way to do this is to allow my mind to drift while I observe things around me.

But the only things worth observing in this room is Kelly, Machala and Maria.

Lucy and Johan are at this place called The Workshop everyday but I have had no idea where Andrew spends his time doing every day.

He never really talks much about it but there's not much I can do from within this room.

While thinking about all this. Kelly, under the watchful eye of Machala and Maria, managed to take another couple of steps.

This time Both Maria and Machala celebrated.

It seems that the attention of Machala and Maria were both being taken up by Kelly which means that the things in the room that could receive my attention was reduced to just Kelly and whoever had her attention.

It was a rather boring but I guess there was something for me to focus on unlike during the time of night when no one moved and there was nothing for me to observe.

Though despite that, for some reason, I find myself transferring into other things more often during those times. 

It is truly a mystery.

...

Today I find myself outside of the room for the first time in quite a while.

While Maria was performing her cooking ritual today with the door open.

I didn't really know what I was doing but I was looking outside the door wondering what it was like outside while reminiscing about the time that Andrew took me outside with him.

That was when I realized that I had transferred myself into the door. 

The time between when I stopped noticing anything and the time I realized I was in the door was extremely short which means I now have a rare opportunity to examine everything I did before I transferred to the door. 

I clearly remember being in my Pandle body right looking out the door while Maria left me shortly after putting liquid into my container. 

By the time I realized I was in the door. Maria had just returned to toss the chopped ingredients into my Pandle body's container.

Which means I only have to go over everything that happened between the couple steps it took Maria to walk over to the surface she did the cutting on and back to my body. 

This was very fortunate since I knew how long it took Maria to perform this part of the ritual and it was a very short amount of time.

However, even knowing this, it was quite the strange since the time I felt has passed between and the amount of time I knew had passed was different.

But that wasn't really important right now.

What I needed to do was analyze everything that had happened before I transferred myself into the door. 

The point where I definitely remember being inside my Pandle body was when Maria poured some liquid into my container.

This was often the first thing she would put into my Pandle body.

After that, I became enamored about the world outside the door.

I started thinking about the day that Andrew took me out after the meal.

And before I realized, I had been transferred to into the door and Maria was putting ingredients into my Pandle Body. 

The only reason I realized this was because I was expecting ingredients to be placed into my body at a certain time after the liquid but it didn't happen. 

That's how I realized that I had moved.

This must mean that I had transferred into the door when I was enamored by what was outside and when I was thinking about the time Andrew ran around with me.

However, considering I transferred into the door. it must be when I was enamored with what was outside that I ended up transferring into the door because that was the only time I had anything remotely related to the door on my mind.

Thinking back, when I first transferred into Andrew, I was thinking about Maria.

And when I ended up in the table, I was focused on the conversation between Roland and Maria.

Would this mean that if I try too focus on something that I end up transferring myself into something nearby?

That would make sense but trying to focus on something had never been the way of transferring to that thing, or anything at all. 

Yet if I don't focus on anything...

Wait no!

This time, I was focusing on the outside.

That means I was focusing on something.

Maybe I have to focus on the things around something?

But how does one focus on many things?

Well that doesn't really matter I better give this a try.

I wonder what I should focus on.

In fact, I had rarely been outside the room that I don't even know what was outside.

Realizing this, I immediately began looking around and taking in the sights.

The atmosphere outside the room was bright.

The roof... well as far as I can see, it didn't exist. 

Instead, all I can see is a blue expanse.

The floor outside the room was green and fuzzy but there was a path that lead from the door out a couple rooms into the distance before merging with another path.

I could see other boxes off in the distance with doors. 

Somehow they looked familiar like the outside of the room I was always in. 

Yet I had nothing to back up this feeling I had.

Far off, in a different direction, I could see what looked like a wall of green.

It was too distant to make up anything more than that but this wall must be very tall considering how far off they were and how tall they looked even from here.

I had no idea how such structures could exist but they somehow reminded me of the stuff that Maria would burn in the fire pits beneath me.

Something about the color of this wall to the base I guess.

Much close to me was some items that looked like tools but I had no idea what they were.

Other than that, I didn't have much else around me.

I decided that these tools will have to do for my experiment so I decided to give it a try.

I tried to focus on all the tools together and shut out everything else.

swapping from one tool to another to another.

I tried over and over and eventually, I was somehow able keep my mind on all of the tools at once.

It was a strange feeling, like I was no longer focused on anything yet at the same time I was focusing on everything.

I started noticing details of everything around the tools as my focus spread and my awareness sharpened.

The place where the tools were placed relative to the door, the way they were positioned relative to each other, the shape of each tool.

It was as if I was receiving information about everything I could ever possibly want to know about these tools.

And then I realized, I had succeeded. I had transferred myself into one of these tools.

I was inside this thing that looked like a giant spoon with a pointy edge.

I had no idea what I was but I was now in somewhere else.

Not only was I somewhere else. I was able to see a completely different area because my perspective had changed. 

When I was in the door, I was only able to see what the door could see but now, I could see what this tool could.

And what this tool could see was the side of the room.

This was the side where there was a opening in the wall that I could sometimes see out of.

But this time, I had a much clearer view of everything on the outside of the wall.

With this new found perspective, I began excitedly taking in everything I could see before me.

But more than anything, I felt a great sense of achievement. 

I was able to figure out how to move myself from item to item.

With that, I should be able to move around as much as I want now.

I cant wait to explore everything there is to explore out there.

Feeling this way while scanning around, I noticed some boxes that were located next to the window.

without a second thought, I began the process of moving myself into one of the boxes.

The boxes were all made of the same stuff the doors were made out of.

Some seemed to be taller, some seemed to be wider.

There was even one that looked round. but it was flat on top and probably was flat on the bottom too.

In fact, these boxes reminded me of the only other time I had seen the clear endless expanse above the roof.

It was clear blue just like this time instead of bright orange.

But I couldn't say for certain if these boxes were the same boxes that were on the weird looking table with round legs.

I took a close look at the closes box to examine if I could remember anything about it but then I realized that I had actually transferred myself into one of the boxes already.

Upon realizing this, a well of excitement well up within me as I immediately began taking in my new surroundings.

Yet despite this excitement, I felt incredibly tired, so incredibly tired.

I felt my consciousness fading away.

The last thing I saw before I fell back into sleep was Maria's face as she continued her cooking ritual.
