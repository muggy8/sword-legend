"Pandle!"

A loud unfamiliar shout resonated in my mind.

The source was a small child, about the same size as Jimmy but this child wasn't Jimmy.

It was someone else.

Mom was standing around too, but dad was nowhere around.

The small child was pointing at my Pan Handle and shouted "Pandle" once more.

"That's right. Those characters come together to form Pandle. You're so smart Maria."

"But isn't it supposed to be Pan Handle? Why is it Pandle?"

"Well, when mommy was tiny and small like you, mommy ended up calling the whole frying pan Pandle and didn't call it anything else. So mommy's mommy ended up just going along with it and we ended up calling the pan Pandle."

"Small mommy? That's impossible! You're always so big!"

"Well, mommy was really small thousands of yesterdays ago."

"So like, the yesterday of yesterday of yesterday of yesterday of... How many was that?"

"That's 4 yesterdays. But it's a crazy bunch more than 4 yesterdays, by a whooole bunch. "

Mom made this exaggerated waving gesture in front of the small and tiny Maria.

"But how much is crazy much?"

"Hmmm..." mom exhaled as she rubbed her cheeks before continuing.

"Stick out your finger"

Maria did as she was told and suck out an index finger.

"Imagine that this finger is how long a week is, now look out the window. Do you see the forest."

Maria nodded in response

"Think about how many days you can fit between you and the edge of the forest."

Maria's eyes widened as mom’s explanation continued.

"That's about how many yesterdays ago when mommy was small and tiny like you."

"That's sooooooo many yesterdays. Do so many yesterdays exist? Are you lying to me?"

"Well... I'm definitely not lying to you, but there's no way I can prove that they do to you."

"So you're basically saying you're lying then right?"

"Well. You can ask any adult too. They'll tell you that all those yesterdays exist."

"Is that so? Hmmm... I can’t imagine it. Mommy is never small and tiny."

"Haha is that so?"

At that, Maria ran off to somewhere else.

After Maria left the room, Mom turned to look at me with a pained expression.

"Pandle... I sure haven't used that name in a long while." she said as she ran her finger along the strangely shaped indents on my Pan Handle clearly lost in thought.

"I wonder what Jimmy would be like today if he's still alive." Mom whispered to herself.

I didn't know much about what was happening nor what had happened but I do know that the Mom before me was definitely feeling sadness of some kind.

Knowing this made me feel sad too, but there was nothing I could do.

Before long, Mom lit a fire under me and started putting things into my container.

This has happened many times before and today was no different from any of those other days.

I didn't know what Mom was doing but nor the meaning behind her actions but before long, I was brought outside to the table once more just like any other day.

"Dinner's ready" called Mom, and like usual, I was placed in the center of the table and I was surrounded by 3 people, Mom, Dad and Maria.

I tried desperately to find Jimmy but he was nowhere to be seen.

In his place was Maria.

Maybe Jimmy isn't going to be here today. There's plenty of days where I would only see Mom.

...

Another day, I rest at the center of the table once again.

And once again, Jimmy is nowhere to be seen.

I didn't know what happened to him and where he went, but I knew that time has passed.

Maria was bigger now, almost 2/3rd the size of mom.

Mom, herself was carrying another small person but this one made no attempt to speak.

Instead it makes incomprehensible sounds ever now and then.

I wasn't too fond of this new tiny person.

Dad never made any comments about using me to cook anymore.

In fact, Mom and Dad barely spoke as they ate.

The only one who would start conversations was Maria and the occasional screams from the little one would cause some chatter too.

The atmosphere of this group of familiar faces that surrounded me has changed a long time ago, yet I didn't realize it until now.

I wonder how Jimmy was doing.

I haven't seen him since the time he made the markings on my Pan Handle.

I hope he's doing well.

...

Maria was bigger today.

She's about the same size as Mom now.

The small kid didn't grow any bigger however.

It's still the same obnoxious screaming mess.

Mom and Dad seemed to have changed too.

They looked tired.

I wonder why the tiny person didn't change at all.

But I didn't know anything.

Other than that, everything is the same.

Well...

Not exactly the same...

Maria doesn't talk anymore either.

When this group of people gathers around me, the only thing they do is to consume whatever Mom put into my container prior.

The only voice was the screaming of the tiny one.

JImmy, I wonder what happened to him. He was such an interesting person.

Jus thinking about him created a torrent of feelings within me.

I haven't seen him ever since that day he gave me my markings.

I've been awake quite a few times already.

Yet I haven't seen him sense.

Maybe I'll never get to see him again.

That feeling inside me hurts.

I didn't know what to do...

Then again, I couldn't do anything either.

I hope the next time I wake up, Jimmy will be around.

'I wonder why I wanted to see Jimmy again so much' I thought as I turned my attention towards the strange indents on my Pan Handle.

Apparently, the meaning behind these markings was "Pandle".

But I had no idea
