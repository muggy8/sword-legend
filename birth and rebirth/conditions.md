# Conditions

By the time I woke up again, things had significantly changed.

Kelly was much bigger than I remembered.

She was confidently running around on her 2 legs now.

Machala seemed bigger as well. 

Maria, didn't change unlike before.

In fact, Maria was still doing the same things that she had always been doing. 

She retrieved me from the hook attached to the roof and placed me down over the fire. 

Ah right, the cooking ritual.

Just like any other day.

I immediately looked towards the door and it was unfortunately close. 

I didn't give it much thought and started trying to move myself into it once more.

Unfortunately, I wasn't able move into it as easily as last time since there wasn't anything else I could be focusing on with the door.

I wonder how I would go about transferring myself into it considering it's the only thing by the wall.

I was lost for ideas as I looked at it absentmindedly.

If I cant move to it if I cant see anything beyond it then does that mean I'm trapped in here until someone opens the door.

Yet if I remember correctly, I didn't particularly looked into anything the first time I ended up in the door.

All I did was look outside.

But if I cant see outside, then what am I supposed to look at in order to move myself into it.

I know that if I focus on a bunch of things that are together, I'd end up transferring myself into one of them. 

But is there any way to transfer myself into something with certenty?

The door seemed to be so easy to get to yet at the same time, the conditions I know to enable transfers doesn't give the best results.

I really wasn't sure what I had to do in order to control my movements.

Well, since I was stuck in this room today, I would have to figure out how to transfer myself with more accuracy.

I immediately started looking around the room to see if there was something I could make use of and Immediately, my attention was drawn to the other cooking containers hanging from the roof.

There were 3 of them and they looked quite similar.

It was a place and position I was quite familiar with which has to make this whole process easier right?

I decided that my goal isn't to just transfer myself into one of the other cooking containers but I was going to transfer myself into the middle cooking container.

With the decision made, I began focusing my attention on the containers as a group.

I recalled the feeling of hanging from the roof, the feeling of having other containers to my left and the feeling of having containers to my right.

I even tried my best to observe the roof that everything was hanging off of. 

Of course, I didn't find anything interesting about the roof that I didn't already notice. 

And then I noticed. that I had transferred myself into one of the cooking containers hanging in the roof, just not the right one.

I found myself inside the container that was closest to the wall.

This was rather unfortunate as I immediately returned to my Pandle body upon noticing this to make another try.

Upon returning to my Pandle body, I looked up into the trio of hanging cooking containers again.

But before I began trying to transfer myself into anther item, I noticed something that I never did before.

When I try to return to my Pandle body from anywhere else, I would always succeed and never fail.

I would also always be able to return to exactly my body.

I have never missed and ended up anywhere that's close but not my body.

I had always thought that this was something that naturally happens but it really doesn't have to be right.

If I can pick out exactly my body when I'm transferring myself back into my body, then there's no reason I cant do that when I'm transferring myself to somewhere else right?

So what do I exactly do when this happens?

When I was inside of one of the other cooking containers on the roof, I didn't even look down at my body before I jumped back to my body.

I just thought I should return to my body and I returned to my body.

But what exactly did I do?

All I did was think about it.

But what did I think about?

was it my body's shape?

I think for a brief moment, I though about being in the fire again. 

So maybe the secret to being able to move between different object is to try to feel like the other thing?

If that's the case then it would make sense why I'd always return to my own body without fail since I know exactly what it feels like to be me.

I guess there's no point in trying to think about this too much. 

Instead, I should just be trying things right?

I looked up to the roof again where the 3 cooking containers were hanging and put my new idea to the test.

I looked strait at the cooking containers I wanted to transfer into and ignored the other 2 containers. 

I also made sure to pay attention to the exact spot in the roof right above the cooking container I wanted to transfer into.

Imagining the feeling of hanging from the hook I began shutting out everything else out of my mind.

Before long, I felt like I was in a trance trying to feel a hook and looking intently at a patch of the roof and before I knew it, I had succeeded, I had transferred myself into the middle cooking container.

It was quite the exciting occurrence but I wasn't sure if I was lucky or my idea worked out.

I looked back down on myself and noticed that Maria was at the part of the ritual where she was going to take me out of the fire.

I knew this process well but I wanted to try something.

If I wanted to return to my body right now, I just have to think about it. 

But if I waited for a bit when my body was no longer on the fire, if my idea holds true, then  an idea I just had would be the perfect way to test it.

And before long, the chance to test out my prediction was upon me.

Maria took my body out of the fire and carried it to the table before reaching up where I currently am and took one of the cooking containers beside me down and placed it into the fire.

I continued looking at this for a while and waited for Maria to arrive at a similar situation she was at while performing the cooking ritual on my body.

Immediately, when this happened, I though about returning to my body in the fire with my container full of whatever stuff Maria often creates during the cooking ritual. 

And to my surprise, I ended up not in my own body but inside the body of the cooking container that Maria was cooking in. 

This perfectly matched what I thought would happen if the idea that knowing the experiences and experiencing the feelings of my target is somehow related to being able to transfer to something.

When I left my own body, I felt the warmth of the fire, the sticky liquids in my container, the brightness of the flames around. 

When my body was no longer in the flames and another similar body was placed into a similar situation, If I tried to return to the flames like before, then, it made total sense that I would end up inside the body of whatever it was that was in the fire then.

With this figured out, I turned my sights onto the door and began trying to look at the details of the door. 

There were hinges on the door that allowed it to swing open as well as a small indent on the other side. 

I tried to picture myself as a flat object once more with my container being much smaller while looking at everything in the room.

It really was a very difficult thing to do but I eventually managed and before long, I found myself inside the door looking at everything in the room.

I could, of course, also look outside with the other side of the door and what I saw what a completely different world from the time before.

The sky was gray and cold, the tools that were hanging around beside the door last time were no where to be seen now.

But that wasn't the most important change. 

The biggest difference was the color of the ground.

It was now completely brown and it looked as wet and sticky as the goop that Maria would create during the cooking ritual. 

Yet instead of being hot, this soggy mess was cold.

Drops of liquid was also falling from the gray expanse above.

I had never seen anything like this before and I was at a loss for what to do or think.

I looked for anything around me I could move to but there was nothing,

the only thing I could do was go back inside.

Yet I didn't want to. 

I had worked so hard to get here into this door.

I shouldn't be so leave.

So I ended up staying in the door and looking into the distance.

The longer I stayed in the body of the door, the more feelings of the door I could feel.

The droplets of water splashing near my bottom edge and splashing the door a tiny bit.

The wind that comes every now and then rattling the handle slightly.

The strange hanging and dangling feeling of being held up by the hinges to the side.

The flatness and shape of the door's body.

I started to feel everything of this door.

It was truly an experience.

Before long, Andrew showed up in the distance with Johan and Lucy shortly after.

I didn't know what was happening and before long, the 3 of them was standing before me.

They each took off a layer of clothing and swung me open.

I felt this swing and the strange experience of screws digging into my body as my position in the door frame changed.

After the three of them entered into the building, Lucy returned me back to where I was originally and I return to being just a closed door once more.

Looking inside, there were 4 cooking containers on the table. 

One more than the usual. 

As everyone got themselves situated around the table, I found myself joining them as I returned to my own Pandle body satisfied with todays discoveries.

Maria and Johan were talking again and everyone else seemed to be quite happy.

I didn't get to see the end of the meal today as I fell asleep shortly after returning to my body.
