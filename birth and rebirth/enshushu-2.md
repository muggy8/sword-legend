# Enshushu 2

A long time has passed since I met the one named Enshushu but I haven't seen him again since.

Lucy now looked like Maria did around the time when Lucy was small enough to carry.

Kelly has grown tremendously, but she's still shy around others.

Andrew rarely comes home now but he does at least once a week.

However, the biggest change is with Machala.

She no longer lives with the rest of the family.

Instead, she lives with someone called Eric.

She still shows up every now and then with this Eric but I don't really know who that is.

When she left, she took one of the cooking containers with her. 

Maria asked her if she wanted to take me with her when she left but she didn't and instead choose to take another one instead. 

I was sort of glad that she didn't take me with her but I was also a bit disappointed that I didn't get chose. 

I have also gotten much better at moving around.

The more time I spend inside other things, the easier becomes to move.

The were still some things I haven't managed to move into yet such as the room itself or even the roof.

However, whenever I find myself inside something new, I'd try to spend as much time as I could inside of that object. 

This helped me get familiar with the feeling of that object which makes future revisits to it much easier.

Now a days, I can easily move myself into any of the other items in the room and even outside of the room.

Lately, I've been practicing moving myself into things that are more difficult to move into such as the small spiky green things on the ground outside the door.

I have yet to manage but I'm sure I'll succeed one of these days.

Those things are just about everywhere and if I manage to do that, I'm sure I'll be able to freely move around. 

However, that's not what I was doing today.

Today, I've decided to see how far I could go.

Maria is going to the workshop to deliver some food to Johan and Lucy. 

Back when Machala was around, she would be the one to take care of Kelly when Maria made these trips.

However, because Machala no longer lives with us, Kelly has decided that she wanted to be with Maria instead of being alone.

That's why I immediately moved into the basket that Maria would be carrying and eagerly awaited the time to leave.

Yet for some reason, the wait felt much longer than any other time I've ever experienced.

Though when I look at it again, for some reason, the whole process of getting ready and leaving was basically exactly the same as any other time. 

By the time we left, the orb of light was high up in the sky. 

I still remembered when I moved myself into Andrew that one time and followed him around on his after dinner activities.

I don't know for how long but after some time, I ended up snapping back into my Pandle body.

It was extremely disappointing but this time, I get to test the limits of how far I could go.

Maria and Kelly walked together along the path not covered by the pointy green grass out from the front door that merged into another bigger path and finally into a seemingly larger and longer path.

As they walked, I could see many other paths that into many other similar buildings to our home.

They were quite spread apart and the paths were long.

Off in the distance were the growths that I recently learned was called 'trees'.

They were curiosities that, according to Andrew, were grown and harvested for various uses.

I looked back towards on the path that we had traversed and noticed that our home looked like it was just as far away as any other home from this point.

It was a welcoming sight since that means if I had mastered moving inside the grass, I'd likely be able to visit another home.

looked towards Kelly and then to Maria again and suddenly, everything went dark again.

It took me a while to realized but I had once again returned to my Pandle body and was instead looking at the roof of the room.

It was an oddly disappointing experience.

'Oh? You're back. I was starting to get worried there for a second'

The voice that ran out was the unforgettable voice of a mysterious Spirit of Fire I had heard such a long time ago.

I began immediately scanning the surroundings to see where the voice was coming from but of course, I couldn't find the source.

I thought that since it was the spirit of fire, it must be coming from the fire in the box but nothing about it seemed out of the ordinary.

'Oh? You seem to be looking around. I'm going to guess you're trying to find where my voice is coming from right? Well actually, I'm actually in this pan with  you right now.'

Hearing this, I tried to look at myself and indeed, there was something strange right here beside me.

Nothing about me physically looked any different but I could tell that something else was in here with me.

It made me very uncomfortable.

Noticing this, I immediately moved myself into another cooking container beside me to make some distance but Enshushu quickly moved to follow me.

'Oh? You seem quite good at this whole moving thing.' Enshushu amused after following me to the other pan.

I immediately moved again to another cooking container next to me and once again Enshushu followed.

'Calm down little one. I'm not here to hurt you or anything ok. I'm just here to give you a bit of help. Have you learned to talk since last time? If you haven't then just stay here in this pan. If you have then give me a answer'

Darn that Enshushu.

I thought as I sat still and waited.

'I see. So you haven't made any progress on learning how to speak. That's unfortunate. Luckily for you, your family has someone who's generally receptive towards allowing Spirits to enter them. I believe his name is Andrew. Imagine the surprise when I found out about this. Anyways. all you have to do is move yourself into him and stay there for a while.'

Enshushu spoke to me as if we were family yet this just made things more uncomfortable for me.

'It's probably somewhat tricky at first but you should be able to do it. By the way, he'll be back today so give that a shot ok. I want you to spend at least a whole day from sun rise to sunset experiencing the world from Andrew's perspective. preferably 2 to 3 times but after that, things should be much easier. Until next time then'

Enshushu disappeared shortly after giving me these instructions. 

At first, it felt odd but soon enough, I remembered that I hadn't even tried to move into Andrew over the past while.

I guess Enshushu's suggestions weren't entirely bad.

I had started this whole moving practice so I can move into Andrew easier.

I guess the only thing left I could do was to wait.
