# **Future**

"Are you sure about this Lucy?" Maria asked with an unsteady voice.

"Yes. I'm absolutely sure." Lucy replied as firm as she could be.

"You know, this means you probably won't be able to start a family anymore in the future." Johan stated.

"I'm well aware of that father."

"..."

"..."

The 3 of them sat quietly around me.

Andrew was missing from the room as he always runs off somewhere after the meal.

However, Machala and Kelly, who were rarely absent after the meal, were also outside doing something today.

Though it was pretty clear why.

"Tell me, Lucy, what are your plans? Father and I have been very supportive of your interest in blacksmithing up to now but even we are feeling a bit worried about the future."

"I plan on being a blacksmith till the very end. I want to be just like Roland. Everyone in town respects him and he's so capable he can turn any hunk of metal into a work of marvel. My goal is to one day become just like him."

"Lucy, there are some things in this world that can't be achieved with just hard work and talent and Roland's skills are one of them. I'm not supposed to tell this to anyone but I think you deserve to know this but Roland has a Spirit Blessing. I don't know the details very well but it helps him with his crafting." Johan explained.

"What's a Spirit Blessing?" Lucy asked after hearing this.

"Spirit Blessings... well, honestly, I don't really know the details of it myself that well but it's special powers that people receive from spirits. I don't know the details of how one obtains it but I do know that it can be passed down from parent to child. I suspect that that's how Roland got his."

"I see..."

"But that's not even the most important thing right Johan?"

"Right. Lucy, you are aware that even if you continued as a blacksmith, no matter how skilled you are, there are limitations that you cannot overcome. I'm sure you've already experienced some right?"

"..."

"Once a month, your lower abdomen churns in pain and discomfort. No matter how much you try to hide it, I can tell. Because it happens to me too. This pain is your body's way of yearning for a child Lucy."

"..."

"Not only that, I'm sure you can tell that your compared to other boys your age, your body is noticeable weaker and your movements aren't as powerful."

"..."

"Come on Lucy, we're worried about your future. There are limits to what you can do."

"..."

Lucy kept her mouth closed yet never making eye contact with either Maria or Johan.

Despite these pleading words, Lucy didn't look the slightest bit convinced.

Yet at the same time, saying these words had no effect on her would also be wrong.

Her face was clearly displaying the amount of discomfort this conversation was to her.

Yet it was also clear that she wouldn't just accept defeat.

"Lucy, what's your plan for the future? When everyone else around you in the workshop has kids of their own, when everyone else in the family starts having kids of their own, will you be able to look back then and think you made the right decision today?"

Johan's words had noticeably affected Lucy, yet still, determination did not leave her face.

"Father, I know what you mean... but I also think that in that future, even if I did have kids of my own, would I not just as like be regretting a decision to abandon my passion?"

Johan wanted to say something immediately but stopped just as soon as he stared.

It was pretty clear why.

Lucy had the same passion as Maria.

Lucy loved to create things, just like Maria, and unlike Maria, Lucy did get the chance to experience being a craftsmen.

Johan knows this, I know he does, which is why it's so obvious why he held his toung.

But Lucy, however, doesn't know any of this.

So she continued speaking.

"Even if I don't have this Spirit Blessing thing that Roland does, I can still create many wonderful and useful creations that'll surely bring happiness and prosperity to countless people. Even if I don't have a family of my own, I'm sure that like Roland, the workshop will become my family. Mother, Father, I know how you feel. I understand why you feel this way. But I'm not going to change my decision and abandons my passion."

Lucy words pained Johan greatly but it had an even bigger effect on Maria.

I have seen Maria's face for a long time, ever since she was as small as Kelly in fact. 

That's why I can tell, even in the dim light of this room barely lit by the orange after meal light, that she was trying her best to hold by her emotions.

She's the type to wear her emotions on her face but when she's trying to hid them, it's very obvious.

Johan must know this too.

And probably Lucy too but I'm not too sure.

"P-please make sure you don't regret your decision Lucy."

Maria barely choked out those words before she averted her gaze from Lucy's direction.

Johan held on to her trying his best to provide comfort yet the effectiveness of such actions seems questionable to me.

Before long, Lucy picked up on the atmosphere and left the room.

"Maria, what's wrong?" Johan asked gently.

"... I... I'm jealous..."

"Of Lucy?"

"Yes... I wish I had the chance to be like her. I wish I had the determination like her to choose my own path. Yet I didn't."

Johan held Maria even tighter.

"When she said that she'd regret not following her passion, I realized then, that that was exactly what I feel right now. I regret being a good girl. following father and mother, directions... I wanted to craft things just like Lucy... But now, all I have is this tiny house and the chores that keeps me busy every day. Johan, what do I do...."

Tears were falling down Maria's face.

A sight I haven't seen in a very long time.

But unlike Mom. Johan didn't do or say anything to comfort her.

Instead, he just held her tighter.

Yet despite this seemingly uncaring behavior, something about Johan's actions just felt right and appropriate somehow.

I watched this tight embrace as I slowly drifted into sleep.
