# Movement

I have a dream.

I want to be able to see the world from anywhere. 

Travel to anywhere I please.

Ever since I got to experience the outside of this room from within Andrew, I've been yearning to do it again.

Yet despite all of my attempts and effort, I have yet to be able to freely do it.

I tried to jump to Andrew over and over again with no success.

There were a few times.

In fact, the only successes I managed to achieve was jump to another container a few times.

Yet even that was mostly an accident.

I had no idea what I was doing.

From the few times I had been able to transfer myself, I've realized that focusing on something isn't the correct method.

Instead, focusing on something that the other is focused on seems to be somehow related to the transfer.

Yet, if that's the case, how does transferring myself to another container work?

I didn't know.

But judging from the number of times I've successfully transferred myself to another body, moving into another container is easier than moving into a person.

But stranger yet, Andrew is the only one who I have been able to transfer into.

I've tried plenty of times with the others like Maria, Johan, Lucy, Machala and Kelly. 

But in the end, nothing worked. 

Even during the time of sleep.

Sleep time was the first time this happened so I thought maybe it'd be easier during sleep.

But I was mistaken.

Sleep doesn't make it any easier to transfer myself into someone else.

Today confirms this as well.

Everyone is sleeping and I'm trying to loosely focus on anyone and everyone.

Shutting out everything else, I focused my attention onto the bodies in the sheets, their bodies under the sheets, the faces above the sheets.

I tried hard to shut everything else out of my mind and waited.

Unfortunately, I'm not very good at focusing and pretty soon, I found myself thinking about various things. 

The conversations that Maria and Johan had, the activities of Machala before the darkness, trying to figure out whether or not Kelly has gotten any bigger, and why the only one I've been able to transfer into has been Andrew so far.

The more I thought about those things, the less I was able to shut out everything else.

Before I knew it, I had transferred myself into the sheets that were covering everyone. 

When I first noticed this, I was a bit surprised.

This was the first time I had transferred into something that wasn't another container with a Pan Handle. 

Regardless, I welcomed the new experience. 

I immediately started trying to start feeling what I could.

I had known this for quite a while now but if I transfer myself into something else, I would be able to experience that thing's senses.

In my normal body, I was hard and ridged but the sheets that covered everyone were soft and flexible.

That made it very hard to feel anythingthing.

Even Maria's hand, which I should be very familiar with, barely felt like anything.

But by using the sheet's senses, I was able to feel everything much better.

Everyone's warmth beneath me, the coolness of the open air above me, the shape of everyone's body, I could feel it all.

One strange thing that I noticed is that despite everyone being still, no one was motionless.

Everyone's chest and stomach expanded and contracted in a stable pattern. 

This was a new discovery.

Taking advantage of this unexpected change in perception, I started to focus on my senses one after another in an attempt to gain better knowledge of the family and the Priority target of my new found perceptions is Andrew.

I started to feel everything I could about him. 

The shape of his body, the warmth of his body, the size of his body, the way his body expands and contracts. 

As I was doing this, a sudden shift in the position of Lucy's posture caused my body to deform and contort until Lucy stopped moving.

This experience shocked me to my core and stunned me.

It was an unexpected sensation.

I was not expecting a part of my body would be reshaped and displaced so easily if at all.

In fact, my normal body has never changed shape before. 

No, that's wrong, Dad changed my shape once by creating indents in my Pan Handle.

But other than that, I had never had my body's shape altered.

But being here, in this sheet, at any point, my entire being could be reformed into anything else.

What a scary experience.

I wanted to immediately return to my own body, yet, I couldn't let this rare chance slip away.

What should I do?

What should I do!

While still feeling troubled another sudden change shook me once more as Kelly started kicking her little legs.

The part of my body that covered her moved in accordance with her kicking and I felt a strange sensation accompanying her kicks.

I was stunned once more as a part of my body moved, deformed and contorted around Kelly's small legs and small kicks.

Please stop.

Please stop.

Please stop.

Please stop.

But there was no stopping.

Kelly was kicking her small little legs and I was here to suffer.

Yet as the kicking continued, the feeling of fear and discomfort lessened as I realized that it's not just Kelly moving me.

Everyone else was too.

Everyone's chest was repeatedly expanding and contracting and this too, had been moving my body as well.

For some reason, I hadn't really noticed this movement till now, or maybe I had noticed but I didn't realize that I was being moved as well.

This realization was deeply troubling.

This body was easily deformed and that deformation was deeply unsettling, yet at the same time, I am able to gain valuable new knowledge and experience.

I was unsure of whether I should stay in this body or not.

This was valuable experience. 

Yet, the uncomfortable feeling of being deformed can't be avoided. 

And as I was stuck in this uneasy decision, Kelly's kicking stopped.

I was once again still.

Unmoving except for the slow repeating expansion and contraction of everyone's chest and stomach...

I guess it's probably easier to get used to this feeling than to run away from it.

After all, if I were to be able to move around freely, surely, I'd have to spend at least some time inside objects that can be easily and freely deformed along the way.

I might as well get used to this feeling now.
