# Family

Today, I was allowed to carry Kelly for the first time.

I felt like a mother already.

Sadly, I wasn't big enough to carry Kelly much and mom was always around to also carry Kelly.

But it felt good.

It must have been something related to my maternal instincts kicking in since even just half holding a newborn felt nice.

Soon enough, however, my little arms got tired and mom took Kelly back.

Even though it was brief, I felt satisfied to have held a child.

I mean, I was already practically Kelly's second mother at this point with all the house work I do.

I've washed more than my fare share of diapers at this point.

Even despite how unpleasant it is, I never felt like it was that bad of a chore and mom seemed happy to have my help in all this.

Sadly though, it seems that Kelly will be the last of the children in this household.

I'm sure it was because of the magic I used when helping deliver Kelly, but mom has been unable to conceive anymore and it's not for a lack of trying.

Mom and Dad had had intercourse many times since since Kelly's birth but to no avail.

It's become a talking point in the neighborhood hangouts of late.

Since it's common to have 6 - 8 children in most households, our household having only 4 is somewhat of an oddity.

I guess it just means that we have to make sure our family doesn't have any of our children die before they reach adulthood.

It'll definately be a difficult task for mom and dad.

If I was an irresponsible demon lord, I'd probably be throwing my magic all over the place to ensure the survival of my siblings but that'll definately cause more issues down the line.

That's why I'll have to do my best to assist mom and dad without having to rely on my magic.

Hopefully my siblings will grow up fine.

Today, Clover informed me that the spirit of fire passed by.

"Did Enshushu notice us?" I asked.

"it doesn't seem like it. But I'm sure it wont be long till we're found." Clover replied.

"What do you think Enshushu is doing?"

"I'm not sure. They appeared in the fire for a bit when mom was cooking, looked around and left. It felt like they were looking for something."

"Any other ideas on what might have been happening?"

"Enshushu really isn't that good at detecting thing from within a fire so unless he moves into something else, it's pretty clear that they're not searching very hard."

"I see. I get the feeling that Enshushu is looking for me."

"How so?"

"I think it's to do with my previous life."

"Your previous life?"

"Yes. My previous life started about 200 years after the demon campaign so I feel like Enshushu probably wants to find me and make sure I don't mess up the future."

"Is that so? The current me hasn't looked that far into the future yet so I have no idea what might be happening."

"That makes sense. I'll fill you in on the key details then. In my pervious life,  I was born in the midst of a great famine it seems and many nations were warning with each other because of the famine. I had considered joining the conflict at some point if things got too bad for the demons but it seems thing stabilized on their own after a while. I'm sure Enshushu probably wanted to find me to ensure that that future still comes to pass."

"Hmm... That seems awful. Why would Enshushu want something like that. I thought they wanted humans to thrive." Clover asked.

"I think it's probably because Enshushu wants the Famine to become a Recorded Event."

"Recorded Event?"

Clover's question caught me off guard a bit and reminded me of the difficult past we both shared.

How long has it been that Clover has been Clover.

Before becoming Clover the spirit of shadow was a proud and knowledgeable spirit of countless eons much like Enshushu.

But it was during the demon campaigns that the spirit of shadow sustained a large amount of damage which ultimately lead to the linking of their spirit and my soul.

I'm sure the previous spirit of shadow would have known immediately what a Recorded Event is and probably would have had many thoughts about it's implications.

This feeling stung me a bit as I cleared my mind and began recalling the information about Recorded Events that the previous Spirit of Shadow had passed on to me.

"Recorded events are events that happen in history that's remembered by many different futures. The details of the event might be different for different futures and so might the timing of such events but if an event becomes a Recorded Event, the essence of the event will forever be remember in basically almost every branch of the future. I'm sure that Enshushu wants to turn the famine into one of those events."

"I see. But why?"

Of course, the next question to come is the why.

This was something I used to always do to the pervious sprit of shadow but now, I'm getting questioned instead.

Unfortunately, I do not have the full answer to this question, and all I can do is to give the best explanation I can based on what I have been told.

Even though after living though so many lives, I start to have a vague understanding of this the reason, I can still only provide what must feel like an underwhelming answer.

"I'm not too sure of the details of this but based on what I've been told Recorded Events locks the paths of the flow of time. Sometimes past Recorded evens can cause future Recorded events. I'm not exactly sure why or how but Recorded Events are special in some way and are somehow fundamental to time, the past and the future."

"That sounds rather vague."

"I know right? This is all just from what I've been told. I've also been told that the more you experience time, the more it makes sense."

"So just living longer means more understanding?"

"That's what I thought at first but that's not what it means to 'experience time'. Instead, it's about living in different times. One example is to imagine living in a different time where I was born as a younger or older sibling instead. Something like that. The more of those time that is experienced, the more this whole Recorded Event and stuff starts to make sense."

"That's rather difficult it seems."

"It does doesn't it. But you've been doing that for a while right? You saw the future where Kelly and Mom died. and other futures where Kelly and Mom lived without my intervention. I think it's things like that."

"Ah I see. so I just have to see more futures then?"

"I don't know. I'm not a spirit so time for me only flows one way. The only time I see different futures is when I get reincarnated."

"That's true. Well if you ever do figure out this Recorded Event thing please let me know."

"I'll keep that in mind."

"Thanks."
