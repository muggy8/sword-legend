# Feeling Human

Just like Enshushu said, Andrew came home that night.

The moment he came home, I started trying to move into him, but with little success.

I know the key is to somehow share some kind of feeling with what I want to move into but even knowing this, moving into Andrew was difficult.

I've moved into him a total of 3 times, but I can hardly remember what it felt like each time. 

The only thing I remember vividly was the orange expanse over my head. 

I'm sure that if Andrew was outside now, I might have a better time with it.

By the time eating time was over, I was still inside my Pandle body with no success in my attempt to move into Andrew.

Same goes for the after meal rituals. 

And then, the room was transformed in preperation for sleep, the fire in the fire pit was extinguished, and eventually, everyone began sleeping.

During this whole time, I had contiousely tried to move into Andrew with no success.

I don't know when but at some point, I had more or less given up actually trying to move into Andrew.

I hadn't felt this frustrated in a long time.

I wasn't even this frustrated when I was trying to figure out how this whole moving thing worked.

Afterall, I didn't know anything then.

But now, I thought I did. 

Yet, I couldn't do what I thought I could.

I had gotten so used to being able to go wherever I want that being unable to move into other things had became an unfarmiliar feeling.

But that wasn't even the biggest point of frustration.

The thing I found most frustrating was the fact that I had been able to do this before. 

I've moved into Andrew twice before, but now, I can't.

I was supposed to be much better at moving now but for some reason, I couldn't move into Andrew.

I didn't know why, I didn't know what I was doing wrong.

All I knew was that nothing I tried worked.

I even tried moving into another object that was similar to my target but that didn't help either.

It was as if all of the effort I had put into learning how to move was worthless.

I wanted to give up.

No, I guess I did already gave up.

So as the time of darkness continued, I rested completely still from within Andrew's bow.

I had moved into here during eating time but it got me nowhere.

With nothing in particular happening, and my attempts at moving into Andrew being a complete failure, I resigned myself to a night of nothing.

I moved myself into the blanket that everyone is sleeping in and settled down to wait for the light to come back.

I don't know why I started doing this but at one point, I started spending the nights in the blankets with everyone else.

As I waited, I remembered the first time I was in this blanket.

The blanket was soft and flexible and deformed easily. 

Having never deformed much before that, the experience of having parts of my body change shape at all was extremely destressing.

But now, I had became much more used to this feeling.

As someone who doesn't deform normally, this was still somewhat uncomfortableat times, but I had gotten used to this feeling already.

As the night continued, my mind began drifting like it always does, remenesing about the times of the past, thinking about the future.

Machala used to sleep here too but not anymore.

But considering how much bigger everyone is now, it's unlikely that they'd all fit into this sleeping arangement now.

Well, Maria and Johan didn't get any bigger though.

So maybe Machala could fit?

It was with thoughts like these that light started returning to the world.

At first it wasn't much, the only change was a brightening of the great expanse that I could see a small portion of through the window.

Then, it got brighter, and brighter.

At some point, it's color changed from black to dark blue. 

By the time it started turning orange, Lucy woke up.

After tossing and turining a bit, she quietly got out of bed and changed her cloths. 

The next to get up was Kelly but Maria and Johan woke up around the same time.

Before long, the only one left in here was Andrew.

Andrew rarely came home by the time I took up the habbit of spending the night in the blankets with everyone.

That's why, when Maria and Johan left the bed, I was fully ready to leave as well.

Fortunately, I stopped myself before returning into my Pandle body. 

Before long, I found myself looking at both Andrew and out the window. 

The blanket I was in wrapped around his body shape. 

As I waited for him to wake up, the expanse above fully changed to orange and then from orange all the way to blue.

At some point, I felt something moving so I turned my attention towards Andrew yet it was at this moment that I noticed that I was no longer in the blanket.

Instead. I had moved myself into Andrew.

Realizing this, I panicked a bit but I quickly calmed myself to stop myself from moving anywhere else. 

It wasn't that long after that Andrew woke up too and when he did, my whole world changed.

My, no, Andrew's whole body bent and twisted as he sat up.

His arms moved on it's own to support the weight of his upper body.

His chest expanded as the all too unfarmiliar feeling of air rushing into his mouth filled me with terror.

He hasen't even woken up for too long and the movements of his body was filling me with discomfort.

This is the exact reason I always tried to leave the blanket before the blanket gets rolled up.

the feeling of my body moving, is increadibly unsettling and all the more so if my body gets twisted and re-shaped so drastically. 

Then with complete disregard for my discomfort, Andrew stood up from the bed and started putting the bed away.

His arms bent and straitened, his legs bent and straitened, his body bent and straitened, and all the while, I was stunned as I experienced all of this.

Unfarmiliar sensations assaulted me with each of Andrew's movements filling me with fear and discomfort.

For the first time in my existance, I felt fragile, like I could break at any moment.

Each time Andrew moved any of his body parts, I felt as if cracks would form at the seams of where the movement happend.

Yet it didn't.

Over and over and over.

Each time he bent his arm, I thought for sure he'd shatter, yet nothing.

It filled me with fear yet for some reason, I remaned inside Andrew's body.

How could I leave?

I had practiced moving so much with the goal of moving into Andrew that there was no way I could just give that up.

And so, I endured.

The normal morning ritual that would be over in a flash felt like an eternity.

Each time Andrew moved, I felt as I would break apart.

Yet nothing of the sort happend as if the whole world was mocking me for even having such thoughts.

I didn't like this.

It didn't feel good.

Yet leaving the body of Andrew was not an option.
